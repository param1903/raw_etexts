## Pipelines
Akshar Anveshini Project has total 4 pipelines:
1) Correction
2) Verification
3) Formatting
4) Proofreading

1. Correction:
   - ️After OCRing, book is passed through the correction stage. Here we have team of correctors, who can read and write Sanskrit. They detect error or missing content from the OCRed files and then they just correct them. Here just basic formatting is maintained.  
     Here expected accuracy of any book/set should be around 90% in terms of Sanskrit content.

2. Verification:
   - ️Verifiers have Sanskrit Qualification. They recheck correctors' work which is done in correction phase. They corrects grammatical mistakes and brings accuracy of any book/set to around 98-100%.
   - ️ Both correctors and verifiers work on "OpenOCRCorrect Software" for error detection and corrections, which is developed by the team of IIT Bombay.
   - Suppose there is no corrected book available for the verifier, and the verifier is available. Then we directly assign them an original set which is not been corrected yet. So, they (verifier) have to do both correction and verification in a single book. (As they are qualified in Sanskrit, they can manage to both work at a time, but it will take more time comparatively)

3. Formatting:
   - ️Formators format the book properly according to the original book. Font size, color, header, footer, alignment, text justification, line spacing and all other crucial formatting are maintained here.
   - ️ They work on Overleaf software, which is web based LaTeX editor.

4. Proofreading:
   - ️In this final stage Proofreaders, who are sanskrit scholars, recheck the quality which is maintained in earlier stage. They make appropriate corrections and formatting. If they find major issues in any book, they return it and this book again pass through respective stages. As an output of this stage, book should be perfect and ready to publish.
   - ️ They also work on Overleaf software.
