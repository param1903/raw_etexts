Dear list members,
Effective immediately, each text in the Muktabodha Digital Library etext
collection is covered by Creative Commons license BY-NC 4.0.
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/

This license supersedes the copyright statement that appears at the
beginning of each text in the searchable library, and we are in the process
of replacing the outdated statements.

The copyright statements at the beginning of each etext in the cumulative
download are correct.

Thank you,
Harry Spier
