INTRODUCTORY NOTE*{The initial work for this text edition and translation was made possible by a grant from
the Translations Program of the National Endowment for the Humanities, an independent
federal agency.}
Since the Gilgit manuscript of the## VajracchedikA ##has already been
edited twice, the reasons for another edition may not be altogether
apparent. There are, however, several good reasons for a reedition. First
of all, the manuscript of the## VajracchedikA-##which contains in addition
three other texts-is one of the most carefully written of the Gilgit finds.
In the introduction to his edition Chakravarti, for example, notes with 
regard specifically to the text of the## VajracchedikA ##that the manuscript 
“is remarkably free from errors....The few mistakes which occur are 
mainly orthographical or are due to oversight.”1 The Gilgit text of the## 
VajracchedikA ##is, in fact, a fine example of what A# PrajJApAramitA ##text
in Sanskrit prose actually looked like in the sixth or seventh century, as 
opposed to how we-under the watchful eye of## PANini ##and the influence
of the expectations derived from much later, mostly Nepalese, manu-
script traditions-might think it should have looked. In consequence
the manuscript has considerable significance for the history of the
“style” of this literature, as well as for the history of the language as it 
was actually written. This is especially so in regard to syntax and the 
use of sandhi and sandhi forms.
But, if all of this is true, then it is of some importance to have as 
accurate an edition of the manuscript as is possible, and this brings us to 
a second good reason for making another edition of the text: both of the 
previous editions are full of mistakes and distortions. Since all of these 
will be signaled in my notes, there is no reason to cite them here and we 
might simply note the broad types of errors that occur in the editions.
In Chakravarti’s editions, for example, in less than ten pages of 
romanized Sanskrit there are at least twenty-nine cases in which the 
manuscript has, correctly, a long vowel, which Chakravarti reads or 
prints, incorrectly, as a short vowel. There are at least seven cases in 
which the opposite occurs, that is, what in the manuscript is, correctly, a 
short vowel is printed in Chakravarti’s edition, incorrectly, as a long 
@096
vowel (virtually all of these mistakes occur at the ends of words and 
involve case endings, gender and number distinctions, etc.). There are at 
least six cases in which the manuscript has, correctly, a plural verb form, 
but in which Chakravarti prints, incorrectly, a singular. There are at
least thirty-two cases in which Chakravarti omits an## anusvAra ##found in
the manuscript, printing an -m instead, and at least nine places where 
Chakravarti’s edition omits entire words which are found in the manu-
script. Although I know very well from experience that some mistakes 
are always made in working from manuscripts, this, I think, is a little 
excessive. 
Dutt’s edition is equally problematic and gives an equally distorted
impression of the manuscript. He, for example, completely misrepre-
sents the sandhi found in the manuscript. There are at least thirty- 
seven cases in which a perfectly correct sandhi in the manuscript is 
printed by Dutt as an unresolved hiatus (-y + a- printed as -i a- eight
times; -e- printed -a i- five times;## - A- printed as –a a- ten times;
-ai- printed as -a e- four times;-o- printed as –a u- seven times,
etc.). His treatment of## anusvAra ##and the nasals is equally problematic.
In addition to this, there are five places where he adds words-once a 
whole line-which are not found in the manuscript, four places where he 
omits words-again, in one case a whole line-which occur in the manu-
script, and in four more places he brackets words which actually occur in 
the manuscript. 
There are yet other reasons for undertaking a new edition of the Gil-
git text. Its appearance might serve to stimulate a badly needed critical
investigation and revision of other editions of the text. The edition of 
the late Edward Conze, for instance, has become the standard one, and 
has recently been reprinted. Yet it is of very dubious value from a text-
critical point of view. Conze’s edition, for example, is badly conflated.
He mixes texts of clearly different recensions and widely different dates,
and does so with a high degree of arbitrariness. He says in his introduc-
tion that the text he wants to present “is substantially that of Max
Muller” which “is based on three documents, all comparatively late.”2
But at 14b, for example, he reads## na mama bhagavan## duSkaram.
DuSkaram ##is not the reading in any of Muller’s three sources, the Gilgit
text or the Tibetan translation. All of these sources read## Azcaryam (ngo
mtshar). ##In spite of this, and without any stated justification, Conze
adopts the reading found in Pargiter’s Central Asian manuscript (which
is probably a thousand years earlier than the manuscripts on which 
Conze’s basic text is based) and the “reading” found in## KumArajIva’s
##translation. This, of course, is not a terribly significant example, but it is 
typical of one aspect of Conze’s methodology. We might look at another
@097
case which underscores even more clearly the arbitrary nature of Conze’s
editorial procedures. At the end of his 17c he omits an entire passage
which is found in Muller’s edition (i.e., Conze’s basic text), because it is 
not found in## KumArajIva, ##Pargiter or the Tibetan text. It is also not 
found in the Gilgit text (although Conze fails to note this) and therefore
we can “infer,” he says, that it “is a later addition which has crept into 
the text after 800 A.D.”3 He also adds that “it is also doctrinally suspect
... contradicting the whole of Buddhist tradition” and, he says else-
where, “the idea is contrary to the tradition of the## PrajJApAramitA.”4
##Obviously, if each editor were allowed to exclude passages which con-
tradicted what he thought was “the whole of Buddhist tradition” or "the
tradition of the## PrajJApAramitA,” ##the resulting text would be little more 
than a personal document. If, on the other hand, Conze excludes the 
passage primarily on the grounds that it does not occur in## kumArajIva,
##Pargiter, the Tibetan and Gilgit texts, then he must also exclude pas-
sages like## evaM parityajan gaGgAnadIvAlukAsamAn kalpAMs tAn Atma-
bhAvAn parityajet ##at 13e,## ‘grayAnasaMprasthitAnAM sattvAnAM arthAya
zreSThayAnasaMprasthitAnAM arthAya ##at 14a or any number of other 
passages, each of which is omitted in all four sources. 
In regard more specifically to the Gilgit text it should be noted that 
Conze’s notes to his edition reproduce all the errors in Chakravarti’s edi-
tion, and that there are a number of cases in which Conze’s notations in 
regard to the Gilgit text are wrong or misleading. For example, at 15b he 
notes that## na-abodhisattva-pratijJai: sattvai: zakyam ayaM dharma-
paryAya: ##is missing in the Tibetan translation, but he does not note that
it is also missing in the Gilgit text. Clearly, then, the text established by
Professor Conze can only be used with the greatest circumspection, and 
a new critical edition is badly needed. The discovery of three new manu-
scripts of the## VajracchedikA ##in Nepal makes such an edition even more 
desirable.5
Given the fact that the Gilgit manuscript of the## VajracchedikA
##represents both an early and a well-written text, and given the fact that
one of my primary purposes is to provide a readily available example of 
what A# PrajJApAramitA ##text in the sixth or seventh century actually
looked like, I have chosen to present, not an edition of the manuscript,
but a transcription. I have added a series of notes-in the most eco-
nomical way possible-signaling the errors and silent alterations which 
appear in Chakravarti’s and Dutt’s editions. I have offered virtually no 
emendations, conjectures or “corrections.” The text stands almost 
exactly as it occurs in the manuscript. This is true of the punctuation as 
well. I have simply reproduced the punctuation found in the manuscript, 
which is, I might add, usually good. I have added no grammatical or syn-
@098
tactical notes, although there are things of interest which fall into both
categories, nor have I catalogued sandhi forms. I have, in fact, done very
little except try to present as accurately as possible the text as it is found 
in the manuscript.
In presenting the transcription I have, for the sake of economy, not 
used footnoting or footnote numbers. I first give the transcription of the 
folios line by line. The second section of the article consists of a series of 
notes for each line of each folio indicating the misreadings and errors
concerning that line found in the published editions. The word or words 
in my transcription that have been wrongly read or printed by Chakra-
varti, Dutt, etc., are signaled in these notes by bold face type, and they 
are followed by statements giving the reading found in Chakravarti,
Dutt, etc. 
In addition to the transcription and notes, I have provided a transla-
tion. The translation is included for two basic reasons: first, to allow 
those who cannot read Sanskrit, but who are interested in the text, to be 
able to see what an early version of this text looked like and, second,
because I think, rightly or wrongly, that the available English transla-
tions of this text can be usefully supplemented by another interpreta-
tion. That, in the end, is what every translation is. The first of these 
reasons has also very largely determined the kind of translation I have 
given. Apart from having paraphrased some recurring rhetorical 
phrases, I have tried, in the main, to stay as close to the text as possible.
This procedure has, I hope, preserved some of the “style” of the original.
It has, I know, resulted in what might most politely be called a 
“Sanskritic” English. I can here only repeat the words of an obscure 
scholar writing some years ago: “In reference to the translation given 
here, it should be noted first that it was not intended to be beautiful. In 
this, I am afraid, I have succeeded beyond even my greatest expectations."

I have added to the translation a few notes, especially where there
are textual uncertainties or where I thought a particular point needed 
further interpretation. The notes are obviously incomplete and clearly 
reflect my own particular interests.

MM and Cz the following passage occurs after## satvA: bhaviSyanty
anAgate ’dhvani pazcime kAle pazcime samaye pazcimAyAM paJca-
zatyAM saddharmavipralope vartamAne ya. ##Cz indicates that all of
this is missing in G, but he does not indicate that Par too omits the
greater part of it. Par probably had only## pazcimAyAM paJcazatyAM 
##and no more. Tib too, though fuller than Par, omitted## anAgate
’dhvani ##and## saddharmavipralope vartamAne, ##but Cz does not indi-
cate this either.## imaM ##Cz has## bhagavan ##after## imaM ##and he does 
not indicate that it is omitted by G, Par and Tib.##
2. paramAzcaryasamanvAgatA ##Du adopts the reading of MM and
Cz:## paramAzcaryeNa samanvAgatA, ##though he cites the actual MS
reading in his n. 2. Cz indicates that G reads## paramAzcaryasam-
anvAgatA, ##but he does not indicate that Par has the same reading.##
api tu khalu punar ##Chak w.## api khalu; ##Cz, following Chak, indi-
cates that## tu ##and## khalu ##are missing in G; this, however, is not the
case. Note that what I have read as## tu ##in G could also be read as## tR.

confused and incomplete. First, he indicates that## na-api teSAM
kAcit saMjJA na-a-saMjJA pravartate ##is not found in Par, but he
does not indicate that it is also missing in G and Tib. Secondly-
and here probably the result of a printing error-since there is a
marker at the end of the passage, but no marker at the beginning to
indicate where the omission begins, it is not clear that G omits all
the rest of this passage as well.## sarvasaMjJA(pagatA) ##in Chak

samAMzena ##and Cz adds a note (pages 116-17) in which he seems
to want to account for the fact that the reading## samAMzena, ##which
he thinks is correct, does not correspond to the reading of Tib. Tib
has## nga’i byang chub phrag pa la thogs par ’gyur ro ##and this, of
course, corresponds exactly with the actual reading of G. Both
Chak and Du must have been influenced by MM. Although the ini-
tial## ma- ##is, in the MS, slightly smudged at the bottom, the dental
s-which cannot be confused with the palatal## z ##in this script-is
absolutely certain and there is virtually no possible doubt that G
reads## mamAMsena. ##Tib then, unlike Cz, MM, Chak and Du, clearly
reflects the “true” reading, and the recognition of this reading 
renders the remarks of Cz (page 116) superfluous. Note too that
@113
##Cz’s text has between## –rimANena ##and## sarve ##the phrase## puNyaskan-

TRANSLATION OF THE GILGIT TEXT
[5a] The Blessed One said: “The number,## SubhUti, ##of particles of 
dust in a world system of three thousand great-thousand worlds1-is
that great?" 
He said: “It is great, Blessed One. That particle of dust is said to be
not a particle by the## tathAgata. ##In that sense ‘a particle of dust’ is used.
Also, that which is a world system, that is said by the## TathAgata ##not to 
be a system. In that sense ‘world system’ is used.”
The Blessed One said: “What do you think,## SubhUti? ##Is A# TathAgata
##to be seen through the thirty-two characteristic marks of a great man?”
He said: “No, Blessed One. Why is that? Each of the thirty-two
characteristic marks of a great man is said to be not a characteristic 
mark by the## TathAgata. ##In that sense ‘the thirty-two characteristic
marks of a great man’ is used.”
The Blessed One said: “But again,## SubhUti, ##if a woman or a man
were to give away their person as many times as there are sands in the 
river Ganges, and if someone else, after taking from this discourse on 
Doctrine a verse of even four lines, were to teach it to others, the latter
alone would on that account produce great merit, immeasurable and 
incalculable.”
Then, indeed, the Venerable## SubhUti, ##through the shock of the 
Doctrine,2 burst into tears. Wiping away his tears, he said this to the
Blessed One: “It is astonishing, O Blessed One, it is truly astonishing, O
Sugata, how this discourse on Doctrine3 was spoken by the## TathAgata, ##as
a consequence of which knowledge has arisen for me! I have never heard 
this discourse on Doctrine before. They, Blessed One, who will produce
a true conception when this## sUtra ##is being taught here will be possessed 
by the greatest astonishment. And that, Blessed One, which is a true
conception, that indeed is not a conception. On that account the## TathA-
gata ##says [5b] ‘A true conception, a true conception’.
“Blessed One, it is not astonishing to me that I am prepared for the
teaching of this discourse on Doctrine, since I have been intent upon it.
Blessed One, those living beings who will take up this discourse on 
@124
Doctrine...4 and master it will be possessed by the greatest astonish-
ment. But again, Blessed One, a conception of a self will not occur to 
them, nor a conception of a living being, nor a conception of a personal
soul, nor a conception of a person. And why is that? Because the Bud-
dhas, the Blessed Ones, have walked away from all conceptions.”
The Blessed One said: “That is so,## SubhUti. ##Those who, after hear-
ing this discourse on Doctrine, will not be terrified, will not tremble, will
not be overcome by dread, they will be possessed by the greatest 
astonishment.5 And why is that? This,## SubhUti, ##has been declared by
the## TathAgata ##to be the greatest perfection. And that which the## TathA-
gata ##declares the greatest perfection is declared as well by immeasurable
Buddhas and Blessed Ones. In that sense ‘greatest perfection’ is used.
“But again,## SubhUti, ##that which is the perfection of patience of the## 
TathAgata, ##just that is not a perfection. And why is that? When,##
SubhUti, ##an evil king6 hacked the flesh from all my limbs, there was for
me on that occasion no conception of a self, no conception of a living
being, no conception of a personal soul, no conception of a person. Nor,
moreover, could there have been a conception of injury for me at that
time.7## SubhUti, I remember five hundred births in the past when I was a 
seer who taught patience. Then too there was for me no conception of a 
self, no conception of a living being, no conception of a personal soul, no 
conception of a person. Therefore,## SubhUti, ##a bodhisattva, A# mahA-
sattva, having abandoned all conception...” [folio 6 is missing].
[“Those who will take up this discourse on Doctrine, will preserve it,
will declare it, will recite it, will master it...],8 [7a] all those living
beings will carry my awakening on their shoulder.9 And why is that? It
is not possible for this discourse on Doctrine to be heard by living beings
who have but little resolve. Nor is it possible for it to be heard, taken up 
...or mastered, by those who have a view of a self, nor by those who
have a view of a living being or a personal soul or a person. That situa-
tion simply does not occur.
“But again,## SubhUti, ##on whatever piece of ground one will proclaim
this## sUtra, ##that piece of ground will become an object of worship. That 
piece of ground will become for the world together with its devas, men
and asuras a true shrine to be revered and circumambulated.10## SubhUti,
##those sons and daughters of good family who will take up## sUtras ##such as 
these...and master them, they will be ridiculed, severely ridiculed. But,
through that ridicule, their demeritorious actions in former lives which
should lead to rebirth in an unfortunate destiny will here and now come 
to be exhausted, and they will obtain the awakening of a Buddha.11##
“SubhUti, I remember that in the past, during incalculable and more 
than incalculable aeons-before the time of the## TathAgata, Arhat, ##Fully
@125
and Completely Awakened One## DIpaMkara-##there were eighty-four
hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of Buddhas who were 
attended to by me and, having been attended to, were not neglected. [7b]
If,## SubhUti, ##after having attended to them, all those Buddhas were not
neglected by me; and if in the Final Period, when the last five hundred 
years have begun, someone will take up these## sUtras... ##and master
them, then,## SubhUti, ##the quantity of merit resulting from the former
does not approach even a hundredth part of the quantity of merit of the
latter, nor a thousandth part, nor a hundred-thousandth. That quantity
of merit is not open to enumeration, nor measure, nor calculation, nor
comparison, nor likening.## SubhUti, those living beings, those sons and
daughters of good family will acquire then such a quantity of merit that
if I were to declare the quantity of merit of those sons and daughters of 
good family, living beings (who heard that declaration) would go mad,
they would be totally disoriented. But again,## SubhUti, ##this discourse on 
Doctrine is unthinkable-unthinkable indeed is its effect.”12
He said: “How, Blessed One, should one who has set out on the way 
of a bodhisattva stand? How should he actually practice? How should
he direct his thought?”
The Blessed One said: “Here,## SubhUti, ##one who has set out on the
way of A# bodhisattva ##should produce a thought in this manner: ‘All living
beings should be led by me to final nirvana in the realm of nirvana which
leaves nothing behind. But after having led living beings thus to final
nirvana, there is no living being whatsoever who has been lead to final
nirvana.’ And why is that? If, [8a]## SubhUti, ##a conception of a living
being were to occur to a bodhisattva, a conception of a personal soul, or a
conception of a person, he is not to be called ‘a bodhisattva’. And why is 
that?## SubhUti, ##that which is called ‘one who has set out on the way of a 
bodhisattva’, that is not a thing.13
“What do you think,## SubhUti? ##Is that some thing which was
awakened to by the## TathAgata, ##in the presence of the## TathAgata DIpaM-
kara, ##as the utmost, full and perfect awakening?”
He said: “Blessed One, that which was awakened to by the## TathA-
gata, ##in the presence of the## TathAgata DIpaMkara, ##as the utmost, full
and perfect awakening is not some thing.”
He said: “Because of that was I assured by the## TathAgata DIpaM-
kara: ##'You, young man, will be at a future time A# TathAgata, Arhat, ##Fully
and Perfectly Awakened One named## S*Akyamuni.’ ##And why is that?## 
‘TathAgata’, SubhUti, ##that is a designation for thusness.## SubhUti,
##someone might speak thus, 'The utmost, full and perfect awakening is 
fully and perfectly awakened to by the## TathAgata.’ ##But that which is the
utmost, full and perfect awakening fully and perfectly awakened to by
@126
the## TathAgata ##is not some thing.## SubhUti, ##the thing which is fully and 
perfectly awakened to by the## TathAgata- ##in that there is neither truth
nor falsehood. On that account the## TathAgata ##says ‘all characteristics
are the characteristics of a Buddha.’ 'All characteristics’,## SubhUti, ##all
those are not characteristics. In that sense ‘all characteristics’ is used. 
Suppose for example,## SubhUti, ##there would be a man endowed with a 
body, a great body.”##
subhUti ##said: “That which [8b] the## TathAgata ##has called a man
endowed with a body, a great body-he, Blessed One, is said to be with-
out a body by the## TathAgata. ##In that sense ‘endowed with a body, a great
body’ is used.”
The Blessed One said: “Just so,## SubhUti, ##the bodhisattva who would
speak thus: ‘I will lead beings to final nirvana’-he is not to be called a
bodhisattva. And why is that? Is there,## SubhUti, ##some thing which is 
named ‘bodhisattva’?”
He said: “No indeed, Blessed One.”
The Blessed One said: “On that account the## TathAgata ##says ‘all
things are without living being, without personal soul, without person.’##
SubhUti, ##a bodhisattva who would speak thus: ‘I will bring about wonder-
ful arrangements in [my] sphere of activity’14-he too is not to be called 
a bodhisattva.15 And why is that? ‘Wonderful arrangements in [one’s]
sphere of activity, wonderful arrangements in [one’s] sphere of activity’,##
SubhUti, ##those have been said by the## TathAgata ##not to be wonderful
arrangements. In that sense ‘wonderful arrangements in [one’s] sphere
of activity’ is used.## SubhUti, ##that bodhisattva who is intent on saying
‘without a self are things, without a self are things’-he is declared ‘a
bodhisattva, a bodhisattva’ by the## TathAgata, Arhat, ##Fully and Perfectly
Awakened One. 
“What do you think,## subhUti? ##Does the physical eye of the## TathA-
gata exist?”
He said: “So it is Blessed One. The physical eye of the## TathAgata
##exists.”
The Blessed One said: “What do you think,## SubhUti? ##Does the 
divine eye of the## TathAgata ##exist, the eye of wisdom, the eye of Dharma,
the awakened eye?”
He said: “So it is Blessed One. [9a] The divine eye of the## TathAgata,
##the eye of wisdom, the eye of Dharma, the awakened eye exists.”
The Blessed One said: “What do you think,## SubhUti? ##There could be
as many Ganges rivers as there are sands in the river Ganges, and there
could be as many world systems as there are sands in that many rivers.
Would those world systems then be many?”16
@127
The Blessed One said:## “subhUti, ##I could know17 the various streams
of thought of living beings as numerous as those in that many world sys-
tems. And why is that? ‘Stream of thought, stream of thought’,## subhUti,
##that has been said by the## tathAgata ##not to be a stream. In that sense
‘stream of thought’ is used. And why is that?## subhUti, ##a past thought is
not apprehended. A future thought is not apprehended. A present
(thought)18 is not apprehended.
“What do you think,## subhUti? ##He who, after having filled this three
thousand great-thousand world system with the seven precious things,
would give it as a gift-surely that son or daughter of good family would,
as a result, produce much merit?”
He said: “Much, Blessed One, much,## Sugata.”
##The Blessed One said: “So it is,## subhUti, ##so it is much. That son or
daughter of good family would, as a result, produce much merit. If,##
subhUti, ##there would have been a quantity of merit, the## tathAgata ##would
not have said ‘quantity of merit, quantity of merit’.
“What do you think,## subhUti? ##Should the## tathAgata ##be seen
through the perfect development of his physical body?” [9b]
He said: “No Blessed One. It is not through the perfect development
of his physical body that the## tathAgata ##is to be seen. And why is that?
‘A perfect development of the physical body, a perfect development of 
the physical body’, that is said to be not a perfect development by the##
tathAgata. ##In that sense ‘perfect development of the physical body’ is
used.”
The Blessed One said: “What do you think,## subhUti? ##Should the##
tathAgata ##be seen through the possession of characteristic marks?”
He said: “No Blessed One. It is not through the possession of char-
acteristic marks that the## tathAgata ##is to be seen. And why is that?
That which is the possession of characteristic marks is said to be not the
possession of characteristic marks by the## tathAgata. ##In that sense ‘pos-
session of characteristic marks’ is used.”
The Blessed One said: “What do you think,## subhUti? ##Surely it
occurs to the## tathAgata: ##’Not by me has a Doctrine been taught.’ He,##
subhUti, ##who would speak thus: ‘By the## tathAgata ##a Doctrine has been
taught,’ he,## subhUti, ##would falsely accuse me by taking something up
from what is not there.19 Why is that? ‘A teaching of Doctrine, a teach-
ing of Doctrine’,## subhUti, ##that is not some thing which receives the name
‘a teaching of Doctrine.’”
He said: “Blessed One, will there be any living beings at a future time
who, after hearing such Doctrines being taught, will believe?”
The Blessed One said: “They,## subhUti, ##are neither living beings nor
nonliving beings. Why is that? ‘All living beings’,## subhUti, ##they are said
@128
to be not living beings by the## tathAgata. ##In that sense [10a] ‘all living
beings’ is used.
“What do you think,## subhUti? ##Surely that which was awakened to
by the## tathAgata ##as the utmost, full and perfect awakening is some
thing?” 
He said: “Blessed One, that which was awakened to by the## tathA-
gata ##as the utmost, full and perfect awakening is not some thing.”
The Blessed One said: “So it is,## subhUti, ##so it is. Not even the most
minute thing exists or is found there. In that sense ‘utmost, full and per-
fect awakening’ is used. But again,## subhUti, ##that thing is the same; there 
is no difference. In that sense ‘utmost, full and perfect awakening’ is
used. Through the fact of there being no personal soul, no living being,
no person, that utmost, full and perfect awakening is fully and perfectly
awakened to as identical with all meritorious things. ‘Meritorious
things, meritorious things’,## subhUti-##but just those are said by the##
tathAgata ##not to be things. In that sense ‘meritorious things’ is used.
“But once again,## subhUti, ##if someone, after collecting piles of the
seven precious things as large as the kings of mountains, the Sumerus,     
here in this three thousand great-thousand world system, were to give
them as a gift; and someone else, after having taken from this Perfection
of Wisdom a verse of even four lines, were to teach it to others##-subhUti,
##the quantity of merit from the former case does not approach a
hundredth part of the quantity of merit of the latter...[10b] it is not
open to comparison.
“What do you think,## subhUti ? ##Surely it occurs to the## tathAgata:
##‘living beings are released by me.’ Not, again,## subhUti, ##is it to be seen
thus. Why is that? That which is released by the## tathAgata ##is not some
living being. If again,## subhUti, ##there would have been some living being
who was released by the## tathAgata, ##that indeed would have been for him
the holding on to a self, the holding on to a living being, the holding on to
a personal soul, the holding on to a personal entity. ‘Holding on to a
self’,## subhUti, ##this is said by the## tathAgata ##to be not holding on, but it is
held on to by simple ordinary people. ‘Simple ordinary people’,## subhUti,
##these are said by the## tathAgata ##not to be people. In that sense ‘simple
ordinary people’ is used.
“What do you think,## subhUti, ##should the## tathAgata ##be seen through
the possession of characteristic marks?”
He said: “That is so, Blessed One. The## tathAgata ##is to be seen
through the possession of characteristic marks.”
The Blessed One said: “But if,## subhUti, ##the## tathAgata ##were to be
seen through the possession of characteristic marks, a wheel-turning
king would also be A# tathAgata.”
@129
##He said: “As I understand the meaning of what was said by the
Blessed One, the## TathAgata ##is not to be seen through the possession of 
characteristic marks.”
Then, again, on that occasion the Blessed One spoke these verses:
Those who saw me through form,
Those who associated me with sound-[11a]
They have engaged in a misguided effort.
Those people will not see me.
The Awakened One is to be seen from the Doctrine;
The## TathAgata ##is the body of Doctrine;
But, indeed, the substance of the Doctrine is not
to be understood,
Nor is it possible for it to be understood.
“What do you think,## SubhUti? Is the utmost, full and perfect awak-
ening fully and perfectly awakened to by the## TathAgata ##through the pos-
session of characteristic marks? Again,## SubhUti, ##it is not to be seen thus.
The utmost, full and perfect awakening,## SubhUti, is not fully and per-
fectly awakened to by the## TathAgata ##through the possession of charac-
teristic marks. 
“If, again,## SubhUti, it should occur thus: ‘by someone set out on the
way of a bodhisattva the destruction of some thing is taught, or its anni-
hilation,’again,## subhUti, ##it is not to be seen thus. The destruction of 
some thing, or its annihilation, is not taught by someone who has set out 
on the way of a bodhisattva. 
“If, again,## SubhUti, a son or daughter of good family, after filling
world systems similar in number to the sands of the Ganges with the 
seven precious things, were to give them as a gift to the## TathAgata,
Arhat, ##Fully and Perfectly Awakened One; and if a bodhisattva were to 
achieve composure20 in the midst of things that have no self-the latter
would indeed produce much greater merit than the former. However,##
SubhUti, ##a quantity of merit is not to be acquired by a bodhisattva.”
He said: “A quantity of merit, Blessed One, is to be acquired,
surely?”
The Blessed One said: “‘Is to be acquired’,## SubhUti, ##not ‘is to be held 
on to’. In that sense ‘is to be acquired’ is used. [11b]
“But once again,## subhUti, ##if someone were to speak thus: ‘The##
TathAgata ##goes, or he comes, or he stands, or he sits, or he lays down’-
he does not understand the meaning of what I said. Why is that? A##
‘TathAgata’, SubhUti, ##has not come from anywhere, has not gone
@130
anywhere. In that sense## ‘TathAgata, Arhat, ##Fully and Perfectly
Awakened One’ is used.
“And if again,## SubhUti, a son or daughter of good family were to 
grind into powder as many world systems as there are particles of dust in 
this three thousand great-thousand world system so that there would be 
just a pile of the finest atoms-what do think,## SubhUti? ##Would that pile
of atoms be huge?”
He said: “That is so, Blessed One, that would be a huge pile of atoms.
And why is that? If, Blessed One, there would have been a pile, the
Blessed One would not have said ‘a pile of atoms’. Why is that? That
which is said to be a pile of atoms, that is said by the Blessed One not to 
be a pile. In that sense ‘a pile of atoms’ is used. That which the## TathA-
gata calls ‘three thousand great-thousand world system’, that is said by
the## TathAgata ##not to be a system. In that sense ‘three thousand great-
thousand world system’ is used. Why is that? If, Blessed One, there
would have been a system, just that, Blessed One, would have been the
holding on to a solid mass. And that which is said by the## TathAgata
##[12a] to be the holding on to a solid mass is said to be not holding on. In 
that sense ‘holding on to a solid mass’ is used.”
The Blessed One said: “And holding on to a solid mass is itself,##
SubhUti, a thing not open to verbal expression; it cannot be put into 
words. It, however, has been held on to by simple ordinary people. Why
is that? If,## SubhUti, someone were to speak thus ‘A view of a self was
taught by the## TathAgata, a view of a living being, a view of a personal
soul, a view of a person’-would he indeed,## SubhUti, ##speak correctly?”
He said: “No, Blessed One. And why is that? Blessed One, that 
which is said by the## TathAgata ##to be a view of a self, that is said by the## 
TathAgata ##to be not a view. In that sense ‘a view of a self' is used.”
The Blessed One said: “In this way,## subhUti, ##one who has set out on
the way of a bodhisattva should know all things, should be intent on 
them. And he should be intent on them in such a way that even the con-
ception of a thing would not be present. Why is that? ‘Conception of a
thing, conception of a thing’,## SubhUti, that is said by the## TathAgata ##not
to be a conception. In that sense ‘conception of a thing’ is used.
“And again,## SubhUti, ##if A# bodhisattva, mahAsattva, ##having filled 
immeasurable, incalculable world systems with the seven precious
things, were to give them as a gift; and if a son or daughter of good 
family, having taken up from this Perfection of Wisdom a verse of even
four lines, were to preserve it, were to teach it, were to master it [12b]-
the latter certainly would produce immeasurable, incalculable merit,
much greater than the first. 
@131
“And how would he fully cause it to appear? In such a way that he 
would not cause it to appear. In that sense ‘fully cause it to appear’ is 
used.”
A shooting star, a fault of vision, a lamp;
An illusion and dew and a bubble;
A dream, a flash of lightning, a thunder cloud-
In this way is the conditioned to be seen.
The Blessed One said this.
Delighted, the Elder## subhUti, ##and the monks and nuns, the lay men
and women, and the world with its devas, men, asuras and gandharvas
rejoiced in that spoken by the Blessed One.
The## vajracchedikA prajJApAramitA ##is concluded.

Notes to the Translation
1.“Three thousand great-thousand worlds” is, of course, hardly acceptable English
but, as Franklin Edgerton points out, “It is not clear what precise meaning, if any,
attaches to## mahAsAhasra.” ##He also notes that “in## mahAvyutpatti ##7999 ff. and##
maJjuzrImUlakalpa ##343.16 ff.## mahA- ##compounded with other numbers means ten
times the number,” and the same may or may not be intended here (see BHSD 259).
For at least one description of what a world system so described would include, see
La Vallee Poussin 1923-31: II.170.
2. To appreciate the significance of the expression## dharmapravegena, ##“through the
shock of the Doctrine,” and of this passage as a whole, see the short but important
paper by## Ananda Coomaraswamy 1977 and the passages from## PAli ##literature he cites
there. Unless I am mistaken, this is an important passage in the## vajracchedikA. ##Its
articulation of a particular kind of “emotively” charged experience## (subhUti ##“bursts
into tears”), a kind of shock-induced realization as a reaction to a certain form of
doctrinal expression## (subhUti ##says “through this discourse on Doctrine knowledge 
has arisen for me”), may in fact be a prototype and paradigm for at least certain
strands of the later Buddhist tradition. In any case, this passage is the clearest
indication we have of the kind of “religious” experience with which our text seems to
have been concerned.##
3. dharmaparyAya ##is a deceptively difficult term to translate. Edward Conze, who I
follow here, translates it “discourse on dharma” (Conze 1974: 76). Charles de Harlez
translates it “cours de la loi” (de Harlez 1891: 471) and Max Walleser “Lehrbuch”
@134
(Walleser 1914: 147). Edgerton says “lit. device, means of (teaching) the doctrine,
and so, secondarily, religious discourse” (BHSD 279). In usage it seems to indicate
first a talk or discussion or even “sermon” on the doctrine which draws out or
elaborates on the meaning of the latter. Were it not for fear of possible
misunderstandings, I would almost prefer to translate it as “development of the
Doctrine”; that is, “development” in the sense of “to lay open by degrees or in detail,
to disclose, reveal; to unfold more completely, to evolve the possibilities of” (as
defined in Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary, s.v. develop). Secondarily, then, it
comes to mean the record of that “talk” which “lays open by degrees”; that is to say,
a “text” or even a “book” which contains it.
4. The marks of ellipsis in this type of sentence translate the Buddhist Sanskrit idiom##
yAvat, ##which stands for omitted elements of a standard list or formula. Here the
whole phrase would be: “will take up this discourse on Doctrine, will preserve it, will
declare it, will recite it, will master it”-editors.
5. This passage is one example of a very frequent, very important, and very little
studied kind of passage found throughout the## prajJApAramitA ##literature. Again and
again the absence of fear, terror, dread and anxiety when confronted with the asser-
tions made in these texts is defined as the Perfection of Wisdom, as the mark of one
who actually practices the Perfection of Wisdom, or-as here-the “greatest perfec-
tion”. Typical of these passages is the following from the## aSTasAhasrikA. ##Here, after
the Buddha has exhorted## subhUti ##to teach the Perfection of Wisdom to bodhi-
sattvas,## subhUti ##responds by saying: "Bodhisattva, bodhisattva’, when this is said,
to what thing does that designation ‘bodhisattva’ refer?  I do not see a thing called
‘bodhisattva’. Nor, moreover, do I see a thing named ‘the Perfection of Wisdom’. I,
not finding then, O Blessed One, a bodhisattva nor a thing called bodhisattva, not
apprehending, not seeing it, and not finding a Perfection of Wisdom, not apprehend-
ing, not seeing it-what bodhisattva in what Perfection of Wisdom will I teach and
instruct?” (bodhisattvo bodhisattva iti yad idaM bhagavann ucyate, katamasyaitad
bhagavan dharmasyAdhivacanaM yad uta bodhisattva iti. nAhaM bhagavaMs taM
dharmaM samanupazyAmi yad uta bodhisattva iti. tam apy ahaM bhagavan

pazyan prajJApAramitAm apy avindan anupalabhamAno ’samanupazyan katamaM
bodhisattvaM katamasyAM prajJApAramitAyAm avavadiSyAmi anuzAsiSyAmi). ##After
this passage, however, the text immediately adds: “But again, Blessed One, if when
this is being said, taught and explained the mind of a bodhisattva is not depressed,
not cowed, not dejected, does not fall into despair; if he is not discouraged, not
crushed; if he is not terrified, frightened, does not tremble with fear-then just this
bodhisattva, ##mahAsattva, ##is to be instructed in the Perfection of Wisdom. Just this
is to be known as the Perfection of Wisdom of that bodhisattva. This is the instruc-
tion in the Perfection of Wisdom”## (api tu khalu punar bhagavan saced evaM bhA-

sattvasya prajJApAramitA veditavyA, eSo ’vavAda: prajJApAramitAyAm). ##The text is 
from Vaidya 1960: 3.5ff.
Similar passages, variations on this same theme, occur throughout the## aSTasAha-
srikA (##4.21, 5.24, 9.10, 11.2, 13.15, 15.28, etc.) but are by no means limited to this 
text. We find, for example, the following in the## aSTAdazasAhasrikA: ##“If again,##
subhUti, ##the mind of a bodhisattva,## mahAsattva, ##is not depressed when the fact of
the isolation of all things is being talked about, is not cowed and does not tremble in
fear, that bodhisattva,## mahAsattva, ##moves in the Perfection of Wisdom” (Conze
1962: 61; see also 23.6, 60.21, etc.) In the## saptazatikA ##we find: “Then## maJjuzrI, ##the
heir apparent, said this to the Blessed One: ‘Blessed One, just as Buddhas are those
@135
bodhisattvas, mahAsattvas, ##to be seen who, after hearing this explanation of the
Perfection of Wisdom, will be intent, will not be terrified, will not be frightened, will
not tremble with fear” (Masuda 1930: 215.5; also 209.1, 211.4, 214.6, 214.11, 216.1, 6,
13; 217.4, 10, etc.). This repeated emphasis on fear, terror or dread in connection
with hearing the Perfection of Wisdom being taught or explained would seem to
indicate that the authors of our texts were clearly aware of the fact that what they
were presenting was above all else potentially terrifying and awful, and that a
predictable reaction to it was fear. And, although these passages need to be studied
further, they already give us some valuable information on the nature of the experi-
ence with which this literature is dealing.
6. Conze does not question the reading## kaliGga-rAjA, ##“the king of## kaliGga,” ##but the
reading of the Gilgit text and the khotanese (kalarri)## = kalirAja: ##would seem to 
further confirm Edgerton’s suggestion that## kaliGga-rAjan “##is undoubtedly an error
of the tradition for## kali-rAjan” ##(BHSD 172).
7. It is Possible that we have here in the Gilgit text a scribal omission. Pargiter’s text
(paragraph 9a) has:## nAsI me tasmiM samaye [Atma]-(saMjJA vA satva-jIva-pudgala-
saM)jJA vA na me kAci saMjJA nAsaMjJA babhUva (ta)[t kasya heto: sa] cen me
subhUte tasmim* sa(maye) A(tmasam)jJAbhaviSyat vyApAdasaMjJA me tasmiM
samaye ’bhaviSya(t) [xxxxxx saM] jJA pudgalasaMjJAbhaviSya[t vyA]pAdasaMjJA
me tasmiM samaye ’bhaviSyat. ##But all of that which appears in italics does not
occur in the Gilgit text. This, of course, looks very much like a homoeoteleuton in
which the scribe may have written the first## pudgalasaMjJA, ##then, through an eye
skip, he may have written after the first## pudgalasaMjJA ##what should have come
after the second## pudgalasaMjJA, ##thereby omitting everything that should have come
between. This kind of homoeoteleuton is in fact frequently found in the Gilgit
manuscripts. Against this, however, is the fact that if this was purely a “mechani-
cal” omission we would have expected the Gilgit text to have## -pudgalasaMjJA vA
’bhaviSyat vyApAdasaMjJA me tasmin, ##etc. But instead we find## pudgalasaMjJA vA
vyApAdasaMjJA vApi me tasmin, ##etc., and the## vApi ##is particularly hard to explain. I
see no way of deciding the case. If, however, the Gilgit text is not to be explained as
the result of a scribal omission, then it must at least be noted that the way in which
it has constructed the conditional sentence is rather unusual (cf. Aalto 1968).
8. The passage enclosed in brackets is translated from Pargiter’s edition.
9. The implied equation the## vajracchedikA ##makes here between preserving some form
of the Doctrine and preserving the awakening## (bodhi) ##of the Buddha is more
explicitly stated elsewhere in the## prajJApAramitA ##literature. ##In the Gilgit manu-
script of the## aSTAdazasAhasrikA, ##for example, the Buddha is made to say: “Ananda,
whatsoever son or daughter of good family will take up this deep Perfection of Wis-
dom, will preserve it, recite and master it, by him the awakening of the past, present
and future Buddhas, Blessed Ones, will be preserved”## (yo hi kazcid Ananda
kulaputro vA kuladuhitA vA imAM gaMbhIrAM prajJApAramitAm udgrahISyati
dhArayiSyati vAcayiSyati paryavApsyaty atItAnAgatapratyutpannAnAM buddhAnAM
bhagavatAM tena bodhir dhAritA bhaviSyati) ##(Conze 1962: 75.16). And the same
thing, in slightly different words, is said a little later in the same text (84.14). There
remains, however, the problem of whether we have here in the## vajracchedikA ##a
figure of speech or a reference to an actual practice. Bearing in mind that the term##
dharmaparyAya ##can mean both “a discourse on the Doctrine” and the text that con-
tains it, is our passage saying that “he who preserves this## dharmaparyAya ##will carry
the Awakening of the Buddha” (i.e., the text of the## dharmaparyAya) ##on his shoulder
in a literal sense, in the sense that he will carry an actual book containing the
“awakening” on his shoulder? Or is it saying simply that he who preserves the##
dharmaparyAya ##will honor the “Awakening of the Buddha,” the phrase “carry it on
his shoulder” being used figuratively to indicate that he shows it respect ? We have
@136
Notes
in fact the same problem in a number of other passages in## mahAyAna sUtra ##litera-
ture. 
In the## saddharmapuNDarIka, ##for example, we find the following verse (III.147): 
tathAgatasya yatha dhAtu dhArayet tathaiva yo mArgati koci taM nara: / evam eva
yo mArgati sUtram IdRzaM labhitva ca mUrdhani dhArayeta (Kern and Nanjio 1908-
12: 99.1-2). And, although the construction here is a little strange, the sense of this
verse would seem to be: “As some man who searches for it would thus preserve a
relic of the## tathAgata, ##just so, he who searches for such A# sUtra, ##after having
obtained it, would carry it on his head.” “Would carry on his head” is, of course, the
literal meaning of## mUrdhani dhArayeta. ##The problem is that the dictionaries give
the meaning of## mUrdhanA ##or## mUrdhani, zirasA ##or## zirasi dhArayati, ##as “to bear on the
head” and “honor highly”; that is to say that the phrase can have either a literal or a 
figurative meaning. 
A similar problem arises in connection with a passage in the## saptazatikA. ##Here
we find:## avinivartanIyabhUmau tvaM zAradvatIputra pratiSThitAMs tAn kulaputrAn
kuladuhitrIM jAnISva ya imaM prajJApAramitAnirdezaM zrutvAdhimokSyante ##not-
trasiSyanti na santrasiSyanti na santrAsam Apatsyante mUrdhnA ca pratigrahISyanti
##(Masuda 1930: 216.11), which Conze translates:## “zAradvatIputra... ##you should
know that those sons and daughters of good family are established on the irreversi-
ble stage, if, on hearing this exposition of perfect wisdom, they believe, do not
tremble, are not frightened or terrified, and if they accept it, placing it on their
heads as a mark of respect” (Conze 1973: 86.) What Conze rather ingeniously trans-
lates “and if they accept it, placing it on their heads as a mark of respect” is##
mUrdhanA ca pratigrahISyanti (##the Tibetan here, as in the above passage from the##
saddharmapuNdarikA, ##is spyi bos len pa), ##and this is only a variant of the expres-
sion## zirasA pratigRhNAti, ##which the dictionaries give as “to receive, accept ... ‘with
the head’; i.e., ‘humbly, obediently.’” Again, the phrase is open to both a literal and
a figurative interpretation. Conze, of course, gives a translation which tries to
reflect both meanings and, although it is difficult, if not impossible, to decide here,
there are passages where the figurative meaning seems to be more clearly excluded.
One such passage is found in the## saddharmapuNdarIka: tatas tathAgataM so ’Msena
pariharati ya imaM dharmaparyAyaM pustakagataM kRtvAMsena pariharati (338.4)
##(“Then, he carries the## tathAgata ##on his shoulder, who, after making this discourse
on the Doctrine into a book, carries it on his shoulder.”) Here, in light of the
specific mention of an actual book, it is difficult to take this passage in a figurative
sense. It in fact seems to be referring to an actual practice, and we may have
another reference to this practice in the much later Biography of## dharmasvAmin ##in
which we read: “When the GurU# dharmasvAmin ##visited the## vajrAsana-saNgha-
vihAra ##carrying an Indian manuscript of the## ashTasAhasrikA-prajJApAramitA, ##the
keeper, A# zrAvaka, ##enquired, ‘What book is it?’ The## dharmasvAmin ##answered that
it was the## prajJApAramitA. ##The## zrAvaka ##said, ‘You seem to be a good monk, but
this carrying on your back of A# mahAyAna ##book is not good. Throw it into the
river!’” (rdo rje gdan dge ’dun gyi gtsug lag khang shes bya bar bla ma chos rjes
brgyad stong pa’i rgya dpe gcig khur nas byon pas dkon gnyer nyan thos shig na re
chos ci yin zer / chos rjes prajJA pa ra mi ta ho shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa yin

tu khur ba de ma legs de bor la chu la gyur cig zer nas) (Roerich 1959: 18-19 and 73-
74). Note that in his translation after “an Indian manuscript” Roerich gives a note
citing the Tibetan as rgya-dpe-rgya-gar-gyi-dpe-cha, but his edition has only rgya
dpe.
##The point of all this is that, although these and similar passages must be much
more fully studied, our passage in the## vajracchedikA, ##when read in light of these
other passages, appears to be potentially much more than a simple figure of speech.
It may in fact refer to the actual practice of carrying sacred books on one’s person.
@137
10. On this passage and a number of parallel passages elsewhere see Schopen 1975. I
would here like to make amends for having overlooked in my discussion some inter-
esting remarks of the late Professor Conze in regard to this formula: “In this context
the## prajJApAramitA ##is then invested with a kind of magical power. It sanctifies the
place where it is, makes it into a sacred, a holy place. “This perfection of wisdom
makes a spot of earth into a holy place for beings, worthy of being worshipped and
revered’ [translating## aSTa ##iii 57]” (see Conze 1948: esp. 119).
11. I know of no exact parallels in## mahAyAna sUtra ##literature to this interesting passage,
but the idea expressed here-that unmeritorious karma could be eliminated as a
result of being abused by others for having adopted a particular practice or posi-
tion-is remarkably close to a set of ideas and practices associated with the##
pAzupatas. ##See Ingalls 1962 and Hara 1967-68. Professor Hara, for example, cites
the following passage from the## pAzupata-sUtra ##attributed to## lakulISa: avamata:
sarvabhUteSu paribhUyamAnaz caret, apahata-pApmA pareSAM parivAdAt, pApaM ca
tebhyo dadAti sukRtaM ca teSAm Adatte ##(“Dishonoured amongst all beings, ill-treated
he should wander. [He thus becomes] freed of evil because of the slander of others.
He gives his bad karma to them. And he takes their good karma” [408]). Our pas-
sage in the## vajracchedikA, ##of course, does not specifically mention an actual transfer
between the abused and the abuser; in fact it gives no indication of the mechanism 
or process by which the “bad karma” of the abused is actually eliminated. In spite of
this, the basic idea here appears, as I have said, to be remarkably close to the basic
idea found in the## pAzupata-sUtra. ##See also Hara 1970. For the history of the##
pAzupatas ##see the summary in the last chapter of Lorenzen 1972: 173-92. It should
perhaps be noted that Jean Filliozat has called into question Professor Hara’s inter-
pretation of the “Transfer of Merit” in## PAzupata ##sources (see Filliozat 1980: 111).
12. Conze in his edition cites a number of “parallels” for this passage:## divyAvadAna
##(Cowell and Neil ed.), 78, 469;## mahAvaMsa (Geiger ed.): XVII, 56; XXXI, 125; and##
KarmavibhaNgopadeza ##(Levi ed.), 153.14 and n. 4, etc. To these I would add only
Waldschmidt 1967: 426-27. The interesting point here, however, is that our passage
in the## vajracchedikA ##is not strictly speaking “parallel” with these other passages, all
of which, first of all, are in verse. Typical of these verse passages is## divyAvadAna 79:
evaM hy acintiyA buddhA buddhadharmA ‘py acintiyA / acintiye prasannAnAM
vipAko ’pi acintiya: // ##(“Thus indeed the Buddhas are unthinkable, unthinkable too
are the characteristics of a Buddha. Of those having faith in the unthinkable, surely
then unthinkable is the effect.”)
Seen in light of these “parallel” passages it would seem that the author of the##
vajracchedikA ##is playing on an old formula. He gives the old formula new meaning
by introducing a significant substitution, while retaining the basic statement. He 
substitutes## dharmaparyAya, ##“this Discourse on the Doctrine” or the “text” that con-
tains it, for the “Buddha” of the old formula, and thereby establishes, for the
“reader” familiar with the formula, the equation of the two.
13. The reader will have observed that I have so far not left the word## dharma
untranslated, and have, in fact, tried to translate it throughout.## Dharma ##is, of
course, a notoriously difficult term to translate, and this fact has been taken as the
justification for not translating it at all. But I do not think this gets us very far. In
our text the term has at least two basic meanings, and in light of this I have used
two renderings. When the term is used to refer primarily to “teachings” or some-
thing taught, as in## dharmaparyAya, I have consistently translated it by “Doctrine.”
When it is used in a more “philosophical” sense as an element in assertions regard-
ing “reality,” I have consistently translated it by “thing,” an English term of equal
richness, intending thereby the sense “whatever exists, or is conceived to exist, as a
separate entity; any separable or distinguishable object of thought” (Webster’s New
Collegiate Dictionary, 883). On this aspect of the term see most recently Warder
1971. This, of course, does not differ radically from the way in which Max Muller         
@138
handled the term in the first English translation of the Sanskrit text of the## Vajra-
cchedikA. ##But, for example, where he would translate “nothing,” I would prefer “no
thing,” the two having quite different senses in English. There is at least one place
in our text, the compound## dharmacakSu, ##where I do not know exactly which of the 
two basic meanings of dharma is supposed to be in play. As a consequence, in this
case I leave the term untranslated. There is also one place in our text where the 
term appears to be used in a third basic sense##-sarvadharmA buddhadharmA ##iti,
etc., at 8a6-and here I have translated it by “characteristics.”
14. “‘Wonderful arrangements’ in [my] sphere of activity” translates## kSetravyUha, ##which
presumably stands for## buddhakSetravyUha. ##Here the text appears to be referring to 
the idea that the bodhisattva-as an integral part of his long career-should work
towards effecting through his accumulation of merit the appearance of a “world,” a 
sphere, which is ideally suited to the pursuance of the religious goal by the 
individuals with whom he is concerned. This idea, and the whole complex of ideas
connected with the## “buddhafield,” ##has yet to be fully studied. Cf. Rowell 1934-37,##
Demieville 1937 and Lamotte 1962: 395-404. 
15. The text has here only## so ’pi tathaiva vaktavya: ##and Conze’s text has the same
reading. But the various manuscript traditions show some uncertainty here and##
Muller ##reads## sa vitathaM vadet. ##pargiter has read-and in part reconstructed-his
Central Asian manuscript## vitatham evaM kartavya:. ##The Khotanese translation
has## Si na baysUJA vUysai hvaJai, ##which Konow translates into Sanskrit as## sa: na
bodhisattva: vaktavya:. ##The Tibetan translation in the Peking kanjur has## de yang
de bzhin du brjod par bya’o, but the blockprint Conze cites has de bzhin du brjod
par bya’o. The uncertainty here seems to result from the fact that the referent of## 
tathaiva ##is not immediately clear; this is a consequence, it would seem, of the fact
that it occurs somewhat earlier. First we have## evam etat subhUte yo bodhisatva
evaM vaded ahaM satvAn parinirvApayiSyAmIti . na sa bodhisatva iti vaktavya:.
##This is followed by a passage giving the reason for this-a passage much longer in 
Conze’s and Muller’s text than it is in the Gilgit and Central Asian text. Then we
have## ya: subhUte bodhisatva evaM vaded ahaM kSetravyUhAn niSpAdayiSyAmIti. so
’pi tathaiva vaktavya:. ##The two passages separated by the explanatory material are 
clearly parallel in structure, and seen in this light it appears that## so ’pi tathaiva
vaktavya:= na sa bodhisatva iti vaktavya:; ##I have translated accordingly. Conze,
without noting it, has doen exactly the same thing.
16. After## bahavas te lokadhAtavo bhaveyu: ##virtually all the other sources have the fol-
lowing passage:## subhUtir Aha: evam etad bhagavann evam etat sugata bahavas te 
lokadhAtavo bhaveyu:. ##The absence of this passage in the Gilgit text is almost cer-
tainly to be explained as a scribal omission resulting from a typical homoeoteleuton,
the skip being from the first## bahavas te lokadhAtavo bhaveyu: ##to what follows the 
second, omitted,## bahavas te lokadhAtavo bhaveyu:. ##Note too that the mechanical
nature of the omission is indicated by the fact that, unless we assume the omitted 
passage was originally there, the construction of the Gilgit text does not make sense.
As it now stands, what is clearly a question by the “Blessed One” to## subhUti ##receives 
no answer, and the second## bhagavAn Aha ##is completely unnecessary.
17. This is one of the very few places where the manuscript is clearly wrong. It has a 
second-person-singular verbal form with a first-person pronoun.
18. presumably here A# cittaM ##has been inadvertently omitted by the scribe.
19. The Gilgit text here is open to at least three interpretations:## asatAd ##may be intended
as an ablative singular of a stem asata, an -a extension of a weak stem in-t. Such
an ablative form is not, however, recorded by Edgerton. It may also be that we 
should read## asatA-d-udgRhItena, ##taking-d-as an “inorganic” sandhi consonant or
“hiatus-bridger” (cf. BHSG 4.46). A third possibility is, of course, that the reading
@139
of the Gilgit text is simply a mistake. To Conze’s reference to## dIgha-nikAya ##III.34,
##we might also add## Digha-NikAya ##III.115.
20. ##“Were to achieve composure” here translates## kSAntiM pratilabheta, ##and## kSAnti ##is
normally translated “patience.” Conze in fact translates the phrase “would gain the 
patient acquiescence in.” It is, however, possible that “patience” is not always the
best translation for## kSAnti, ##especially if “patience” is used with the implication of “to
endure.” As I understand the term, it more commonly means not “to endure” or “to
accept” but to remain “unaffected by,” and I think the present passage is a good
example of this. Unless I am very much mistaken, the phrase## nirAtmakeSu
dharmeSu kSAntiM pratilabheta, ##which I translate as “to achieve composure in the 
midst of things that have no self,” is intended above all else as a positive expression
of the state of mind that is much more commonly expressed in negative terms, 
several examples of which are cited above in n.5. That is to say, to obtain## kSAnti ##is 
the positive expression for the same state which is negatively expressed by such for- 
mulae as “he is not depressed, not cowed, not dejected... he is not terrified, fright-
ened and does not tremble with fear.” But the opposite of dejection, terror and fear
is not patience or endurance, it is rather something more like composure. Note too
that in almost every case the absence of fear and dread and the obtainment of ## kSAnti
##are to take place in regard to the same basic fact, however expressed: the absence of 
a self. The proper reaction to this fact, and the full realization of its implications,
may be expressed either positively by saying “he obtains composure in regard to it,”
or negatively by saying “he is not terrified, alarmed, frightened, etc.” In the end they
are very much the same.
