Laukikanyāyakosa (An Anthology of Popular Maxims) 
IC 
The word Nyāya has so many connotative facets in Sanskrit and in other Indian languages that one has to ascertian the exact connotation of Nyāya in the concerned work. 
Though Nyaya often means justice, it expresses many more meanings. Infact, Apte's Dictionary has assigned the following twelve sets of meaning to this word. 
(i) Method, manner (ii) Fitness, propriety 
Low, justice, Virtue, equity, righteousness. (iv) A law suit, (V) Judicial sentence, (vi) Policy, good government (vii) A popular maxim (viii) An opposite illustration, (ix) Vedic account. (x) A universal rule. (xi) System of Hindu philosophy founded by the sage 
Gautama. (xii) Syllogism-An epithet of Vişnu 
The word is well-known in the sense of "the science of Logic”. It is also well-known as a group of words conveying some incidents or events, based on worldly dealings or 
(vi) 
experiences. Such group of words is also called a maxim or an adage. As it is strongly based on the behaviour of worldly beings, the word (maxim), the ultimate or the final word of which is Nyāya. It also conveys some special type of behaviour not only of the human being but also of the birds and animals, The maxim, thus formed, does not always directly indicate the pattern of behaviour, unless the pattern involved is expatiated. Thus many Nyāyas are properly understood by the references to the context of the anecdotes or events. 
The Šāstras Sūtras are very brief and some what incomprehensible at the beginning. So also the maxims are brief, inostly embodied in one compound with vaguc or concealed incidents. The maxim can be reframed into a sentence with a slight change. Nyāya is connected with the group of words where in the Nyāya converts some incident into an adage. It is, however, endowed with some significance. 
A Nyāya can be contrasted with an idiom. The Advance Oxford dictionary defines an idiom as a phrase or a sentence whose meaning is not clear from the meaning of its individual words and which must be learnt as a whole unit. The maxim or a Nyāya is the crystalization of some event or a legend. Buhler calls the Nyāya as the inferences from familiar utte rances. The Oxford diction defines maxim as a saying that expresses a general truth or a rule of conduct. There are such maxims in English as well as in other languages bur they are crystalized in Nyāya type phrases of Sanskrit. The Nyāyas are condensed legends, throwing light on the human behaviour (and that of other beings also). The Nyāyas per meates wide spheres of human beings, animals, trees and even inanimate objects. Some scholars have tried to collect as many maxims as possible and have given explanations, based on their usages in several Sanskrit works. 
Colonel G. A. Jacob has collected Nyāyas which are 
(vii) 
combined in one volume (the book is published by Niranjanā publishers and Book sellers, New Delhi, 1983). These Nyāyas are chosen from various fields including the S'āstric works. They encompass different types of beliefs, principles or articles of faith, minor experiences, canons, deeds, crescendos, catechisms etc. They underline some popular legends prevalent in folklores which are surrounded with classical aura. As they are prudent in nature, they enrich the literature and give it a didactic tinge. 
The Nyāya gives some suggested sense. Thus it might have been clear that a variety of experiences constitute the main story of the Nyāya or the maxim. In course of time, the experiences were crystalized in ever growing manner in the conversations, in different regions, different action-reaction plans. The efflorescence of human mind with all its glories and dark sides have shaped various maxims. Any maxim presupposes three stages (1) the experience, (11) couching the experience briefly in words and then (iii) casting searching light on human behaviour. The maxims, however, become impersonal. As such, they attain an abiding place in the human communications and in the folk literature too and then to the classical literature. 
The next problem is the classification of the maxims under probable heads. Some broad method of classification is suggested by the author of the oldest anthology of the Nyāyas-Bhuvanesalaukikanyāya sāhasrī. 
ये चात्र लौकिकन्यायाः प्रोक्तास्तेषामुदाहतिः। 
वेदान्तशास्त्रगा काचित् कचिच्च शब्दशास्त्रगा॥६॥ काचिभ्यायानुगा काचिन्मीमांसा शास्त्र गा तथा। लौकिकोक्तिर्यथा तद्वत् प्रायः प्रोक्ताऽपरापिवा॥७॥ 
अर्थमात्रं क्वचित्तेषामधे स्पष्टे स्फुटं स्मृतम्। प्राय: सक्षेपतः प्रोक्तं विस्तरादपि च क्वचित्॥८॥ 
(viii) 
Thakura Datta Sharma, the editor of the works, has given an alphabetical list of all the Nyāyas at the beginning. He has tried to find out a common link in the body of the works, wherever possible, to cluster the Nyāyas together 
The book, printed in 1908, is the oldest printed colleclion of the Nyāyas. The writer has exhaustively quoted from the Sanskrit literature including the Sūtras of Pānini. He has cited lines containing some popular beliefs at some places e.g. opera fui t :- in which the lines-- 
लता हि शैले-सरसि भवम् सरोजम्-पुष्पाणां प्रभवो वै। are quoted, though the original works in which their occurances are not traceable. Thus with a fine exegetical skill, Thakura Datta Sharma has enriched the selection. 
Explanations of certain Nyāyas occurs in certain commentorial works but they are only incidental and cannot be designated as Nyāyakośas. 
Nyāyakośa work which is now available is- cifticorpio A handful of popular maxims are published in three parts during the period 1900-1904. Jacob has explained in these tracts the maxims, quoting lines from the classical as well as from the Sāstric works. He has prepared an enlarged version during 1907-1911, in which the total number of Nyāyas was 484. I have considered this collection of the maxims as the most dependable one. 
The next available work on the Nyāyas is the “Nyāyokti kośa"--published by Chavinath Mishra in 1978. They have been discussed in Sanskrit only. 
Prof. Dr. R. Srihari, Retired Vice-Chancellor, Dravidiani University, Kuppam-a well-known Telugu. Sanskrit scholar, has written a Nyāyakośa in Telugu. It was published by Surabharati Samiti, Hyderabad in 1993. This work has been 
of inunense inspiration and help to me in the preparation of this work. 
The work of Colonel Jacob was an ideal before me. I have adopted his discussion (with slight changes) in interpreting the Nyāyas. He has taken illustrations from various works like 'Vācaspatya', the works of Satyavrata Sāmāśrami and Raghunātha Varmā. He has appended a list of Nyāyas, arranged in alphabetical order in Devanagari script. One more book has been recently published which has discussed Nyāyas from the Mahābhāṣva of Patanjali. 
The Nyāyas may be classified mainly under the following topics: 
1. Nyāyas related to mountains etc. 2. Nyayas related to ladies. 3. Nyāyas related to rural situations. 4. Nyayas like Arundhatidarśan nyāya, 5. Nyāyas related to social conditions. 6. Nyāyas like Brāhmaṇa Vasiştha nyāya. 7. Nyāyas like Dandāpūpa nyāya. 8. Nyāyas related to food articles etc. 9. Nyāyas related to animals and birds 10. Nyāyas like Gobalivardanyāya, Hansaksirodaknyāya. 11. Nyāyas like Khalekapota nyāya. 12. Nyâyas concerning deities. 13. Nyāyas concerning Šāstra conventions. 14. Nyāyas like Nāgļhitavićeşaņa nyāya, Sandansa nyāya. 15. Nyāyas related to Agriculture etc. 
The early Šāstra writers have added the word Nyāya to certain epigrammatic Sāstra rules, like फलवत् सन्निधानफल तदङ्गम्। 
Cf. (Sabara's commentary on Jaimini vii.2.13). Many such examples have been given by Dr. P.V. Kane in his history of Dharmaśāstra, Vol. V, part II, pp. 1339-1359. This is my humble attempt of collecting the Nyāyas although there are limitations also. 
This work is an attempt of placing together the work done by earlier scholars briefly. As far as possible, I have assigned at least one illustration for one Nyāya. I have taken some illustrations mainly from the book “Bhuvanesanyāya sāhasri”. If a sustained effort is made, many more Nyāyas and illustrations can be collected. Unfortunately, I have to restrict myself to a few ones only. I implore the scholars 10 look at this work as an effort of summarizing the carlier works. This work has incorporated the treatment of Nyāyas, carried out by the three works 
(i) Bhuvanesalaukika nyāya sāhasrī, (ii) Jacob's collection of popular maxims and (iii) Prof. R. Srihari's Laukikanyāyakosa. I have only 
taken bath in this Triveni sangana. I have freely 
utilized the sacred water of the confluence. Needless to say that there is little originality in it. I will deem myself fortunate, if more exhaustive collections of Nyāyas are brought out by the scholars

3164797 ITT: 
Just as a little, minute dust particle when fallen into the eye, causes irritation, similarly even a small and trivial trouble causes much suffering to a man of delicate and sentimental nature. अक्ष्याप्तभेषजन्यायः If the medicine meant for applying to the eyes is applied to the testicles, it will not give any effect. It will become useless. The maxim suggests this act of purposeless deed, having no effect. It also means that though the pupil of the eye is very small, it can see the most subtle 
things. 
अगतिकगतिन्यायः A person who is in distress, tries to extricate himself from that difficult situation by taking help of anything weak or otherwise which is at hand. Here time is given more importance than means. 
अग्निकुण्डन्यायः A Brahmin wanted to perform a sacrifice. In order to keep the material at hand, he kept all the material required for the sacrifice, including the fire, in a jar, with the idea of collecting all the things at one place.

But everything was burnt down when he came to that place, the next morning. The nature of the dull-witted fellows who have no knowledge about the worldly affairs is described here. 377-TTTRICT: Attracted by the light, a glow-worm jumps on the flame and is completely burnt down. The maxim suggests that doing something rashly and submitting oneself to ephemeral lure, leads one to ruin. 
अग्निशिखान्यायः As the flame of the fire always goes up, it is also natural for the soul to go upwards. This is suggested in *Sarvadarśana Samgraha"-a book by the Jain philoso phers. This work gives four illustrations of the natural movements of the following things: (i) Rotation of a potter's wheel. (ii) Floating on water of a gourd whose mud cover 
is removed. The fallen seed of a castor tree goes up and 
sticks to the tree. (iv) The upward surge of a flame. 
अग्न्यानयनन्यायः 
When somebody is asked to bring fire, he fetches it in some pot or vessel, even though he is not specifically told to bring it in a vessel. The substratum and the substrated are inseparable. 
अङ्कोलबीजन्यायः The seeds of the Ankola tree fall down but peculiarly enough, they go back and cling to the tree after the rain-showers in Mrgasiras. This suggests that ary object

or any individual can restore its or his original position in favourable environment, despite the fact that they had fallen down earlier. 
अङ्गारन्यायः If the burning charcoal is placed in the hand, the hand gets burnt. If it is touched when it is cooled down, the hand becomes black and dirty. Coal, in any state, is harmful. Similary, the company of the wicked persons is always harmful. अङ्गलिदीपिकाध्वान्तध्वंसन्यायः A small little lamp of the size of a finger can remove the darkness. Some people use a big torch to remove the darkess. But how far and to what extent can it obliterate the darkness? It is impossible to remove the darkness completely. This maxim suggests that even a small device may bring about big effect. 
अचलचलन्यायः Sometimes a static thing seems to be moving or stationary. When this kind of delusion is caused, this maxim is employed. This kind of delusion is caused when one moves in a running vehicle. The objects which are passed en route, seem to be moving. Many a time, one gets a delusion that the moving boat is still. Similarly a fast moving top seems to be static and the blades of the fast moving fan are invisible. Thus this maxim states that a delusion is caused regarding moving 
and non-moving objects too. 
अज्झलन्यायः Example-Toolfonisfo TTUR HR Hral591 2007 नानीव नि:सत्त्वाः परेषामनुगामिनः॥ 
-HO 934 In Sanskrit also, there are two types of letters, vowels

and consonants. Consonants cannot be articulated without the help of vowels. The consonants (Hals) are powerless without vowels (Acs). This maxim is used when dependence of one on some other is to be indicated. 
अजगरन्यायः Due to the long and heavy body, it is difficult for a boa to move about. So any creature which comes near it by chance, it swallows it. Similarly, a crane waits silently for a chance to catch a fish which comes within the range of catching. 375Ertareafira: 'Vștti' is the function of a word by which the meaning of a word is conveyed by some another word. When some primary meanings give up their meaning-this function of conveying secondary meaning is called 'Jahatsvārtha'. Patañjali has dealt with this topic in his commentary on Paņinian sâtra. "Samarthah Padavidhi" --this function is one of the functions of Lakşaņā by which secondary meaning is conveyed, without the original sense being given up. 
अजाकृपाणीयन्यायः It a she-goat and a knife happen to come together, it is the she-goat which suffers and not the knife-When something happens accidentally, this maxim is used. This accidental and unknowing happenings are also indicated in “Käkatāliya” and “Khalvāta bilvīya" nyāyas. 3767TGATTITAT: 
धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणां यस्यैकोऽतिप न विद्यते। 
अजागलस्तनस्येव तस्य जन्म निरर्थकम्॥

19. 
no role to perform in the bodily functions of a goat. This maxim is used to point out such useless or 
purposeless things. 17. अजाण्डपरीक्षान्यायः 
How many testicles does a goat have? How are they or how do they look ? All these are useless questions. 
This maxim is used for describing similar questions. 18. अजातपुत्रनामोत्कीर्तनन्यायः 
To praise the virtues of an unborn son and sometimes, even to christen him before his birth, shows the unnecessary haste which is indicated in this maxim. 
अजायुद्धन्याय: Cf.-प्रभातमेघन्यायः The fight between the goats starts with forceful attacks but their force is reduced gradually and everything ends in peace. Similar situation which appears violent 
but ends in peace, is envisaged by this maxim. 20. अण्डकुक्कुटीन्यायः 
There is an unanswerable question, who is the earlier one-a hen or an egg? Similarly the question is--which is earlier,. a seed or a sprout ? There seems to be cause-effect relation, ultimately. 
अण्डविस्त्रम्भन्यायः This maxim is employed to describe a situation when somebody does an adventurous act, believing someone unreasonably or when someone commits a rash action 
thoughtlessly. 22. अतिदेशन्यायः

Prof.V.K.Lele has the following explanation to offer--- (Extention of application to analogous topics). connecting the properties of one with those of the other or superimposing of one upon those of the other is 'atidesa'. 
Prof. Lele has cited many definitions of "atidesa". Some of them are given below..-. (i) अतिदेशस्तु पूर्वोक्तन्यायस्यसान्यानुषाड्गिता।

maxim. The Bhillas use scented, expensive sandal wood as firewood because they get it easily and in plenty on the Malaya mountain. They do not think about the value of the sandal and burn it like ordinary fire wood- This is an example of too much of familiarity 
leading to contempt. 24. TAHFUIFTER14: 
A person owned a buffalo. He loved that buffalo very much. As days passed, he decided to retire from Grhasthāśrama and enter Vānaprasthāśrama. (life of detachment). One has to leave everything in this stage of life. But this person could not give up his love, affection or attachment for the buffalo. This indicates 
that old ties are difficult to be asundered,

Fire can burn things which are not already burnt. It cannot burn the things already burnt. Patañjali has employed this maxim while commenting on a sūtra of Pānini. 
अधिकरणसिद्धान्तन्यायः Example—whefuferereitend hafirahcuty1 
tema 37effire, go 4 Adhikaraņa (topic) is a systematic arrangement of discussion or treatment about a topic. It contains five stages:- subject, doubt, prima facie views, the final view of the arguer and the final conclusion. The maxim is applied to a situation wherein one theory is advanced to substantiate the previous one.

When a wrong imputation is refuted, it is called Apavāda. According to Vedānta, these two operations help one, to arrive at 
the right knowledge of the Supreme. 29. अनवस्थान्यायः Cf. देहलीदीपन्यायः

-ब्रह्मसूत्र, शाङ्करभाष्य 2-2-13. When the matter to be proved and the manner in which it is proved, become endless (i-e-reaches a stage of impasse), this maxim becomes applicable to that situation. It is also called reductio ad absurdum. अनारभ्याधीतविधिन्यायः When a particular injunction is not related to a particular topic, the injunction is concerned with the natural import only. Thus when that is not applicable to a particular

matter and when there is no earlier reference to it, this maxim comes into picture. 
अनेकान्तवादन्यायः This maxim suggests uncertainty (indefiniteness). The word Anekānta is used in Jaina philosophy which describes seven possibilities of uncertainty. Some uncertainties can be spoken about Fate. 
अनेकाश्रयन्यायः This maxim conveys a message that it is better to take support of one strong man than resorting to many weak fellows. 
अतरङ्गबहिरङ्गन्यायः Examle--यं धर्मा अपूर्वाथस्तेि साक्षादपूर्वेण सम्बध्यमानोस्तदड्गेषु प्रवर्तमाना अन्तरङ्गे तावदापतन्ति। ततो प्यवहिते बाहिरङ्गे। यत्रव पूर्वमापतति तत्रैव तिष्ठति, तरतिक्रमे कारण भावात्॥ 
__--शाबरभाष्य जै०सू०, XII.2. 11, पाणिनि I.1.4.1.15. The closer i.e., proximity aspect of anything is stronger than the remote (or external) aspect of it. This rule is 
often referred to in grammar and Mîmāmsā.

This maxim is used to describe a person who performs various tasks, remaining at one place. 
अन्धकरदीपिकान्यायः A mirrror or a lamp is of no use to a blind man. If a person is incapable of using or appreciating the qualities of a particular thing, it is useless for him. This is the purport of this maxim.

अन्धकवर्तकीयन्यायः संसारसागरमिमं भ्रमता नितान्तं जीवेन मानवभवः समवापि दैवात्। तत्रापि यद् भुवनमान्यकुले प्रसूतिः सत्सङ्गतिश्च तदिहान्धकवर्तकीयम्॥ -- HIO 655 A blind man was clapping his hand aimlessly, Incidentally a bird called Vartika (a kind of quail) got caught up in his hands. Fortunately, without any effort or without any idea he got the bird. This is a rare happening. Similarly in our life also, many things happen due to our good luck or by coincidence. 
अन्धकूपन्यायः Once a blind man was asked to go straight. But he connived at this advice and ultimately fell in a ditch. This maxim suggests that he who does not abide by wholesome advice, is sure to face peril. 
-T10 493

3T-TTTTT: Some blindinen were sitting together. A man with his elephant came there. He asked the blind persons to describe the animal. Some blindmen touched his pillar like feet, some his winnowing basket-like ears, some his long tusk and some his little tail at the back, and began to describe the elephant accordingly. As all of them could not see the animal, they could not give a complete, integrated picture of the elephant. The maxim throws light on the people who have partial knowledge of certian thing and think that the entire thing exists like that.

-ब्रह्मसूत्र, शाङ्करभाष्य 1.7, सा० 40 A blindman who was moving falteringly on a street, was advised by an ordinary man to catch hold of the tail of a cow to reach home. Even though the blind man moved about catching the cow's tail in the whole town, he could not reach home. An innocent person is often deceived by a shrewd man. This is the indication of this maxim. 
40. 
अन्धचटकन्यायः 
41. 
Once a sparrow was caught in the hands of a blindman. The blind man began to blare out, “I have caught a sparrow. Look a sparrow has been caught by me". This maxim describes those who want to take the credit of the deeds which are not acually performed by them. 
अन्धदर्पणन्यायः A blindman has no use of a mirror. He cannot see his face in it and use it. This maxim suggests that it is useless to offer something to a person for whom it is of 110 use. 
अन्धपङ्गन्यायः See (i) तन्त्रवार्तिक, पृ० 11, 72, 75, 232, 799, 897. (ii) शांकरभाष्य, पृ० 250, 254. (iii) न्यायमञ्जरी, पृ० 234, 249, 251, 425, 492; सा० 179 Once a blind man and a lame man came together accidentally. Both of them could not move about

independently, as the blind was unable to see and the lame could not walk. They thought of a trick. The blind man took the lame man on his shoulder who could guide him, and show him the proper path. With the co.operation of both of them, they were able to reach their destined place. This maxim is made use of in many philosophical works. 
अन्धपरम्परान्यायः अनादित्वेऽपि अन्धपरम्परान्यायेनाप्रतिप्ठैवानवस्थाव्यवहार लोपिनी स्यान्नाभिप्रायसिद्धिः। 
-HO 24 (i) A blind man does work which is done likewise by 
another blindman and it is followed by another 
blindman and so on. (ü) Sometimes this maxim describes a situation when 
nothing is steady and the instability persists. This 
is called contingency of endlessness. 3PRMATHICRIPT: In the case of certain persons, the physical movements do not bring about any change in their personality. Closing of the eyes is not of any significance to a blind man. 
अन्धाञ्जनयायः This maxim suggests that ineffective device should not be used. It is futile to apply collyrium to the eyes of a blind man. 
अन्धानन्दन्यायः A blind man may be joyful in two situations:--- (i) When his blindness disappears or (ii) When he becomes a Yogin and gets the supreme bliss of realizing the Truth.

This maxim tells that physical deformity of a man docs not prove to be an impediment in his eating habits. Even

अपृच्छोत्तरन्यार : The maxim observes that answering an unasked question is the sign of lack of discretion. 
अप्रसक्तनिषेधन्यायः The maxim observes that there is some chance of prohibition when one sentence is related to the other. There is no possibility of any prohibition in connection with the unconnected sentences. 
अब्धिफेनादिन्यायः The waves and the foam which arise in the ocean, appear to be different from the sea. The projective illusion in the ocean makes foam and waves appear differently. The same māyā or delusion displays many worldly things in the Brahman. The extension in the form and name is illusory. This is the main thrust of the present maxim.

This maxim describes the tendency of a frustrated man. When he is unsuccessful in obtaining something, consoles himself saying "Good, I did not get the thing. But actually I do not need that thing at all." "Grapes are sour” to the fox which could not get the grapes even after many trials. अभावविरक्तिन्यायः This indirectly lays down the prohibition of 10!

This maxim implies life as a whole. 
अरुणान्यायः Cf. जैमिनीसूत्र III 2.12; याज्ञवल्क्य III. 205 This maxim refers to a Mimāmsā arrangement. In one of the sentences in Taittiriya Samhitā, it is mentioned that a cow which is reddish, is one year old and has only one eye, should be exchanged for purchasing of Soma. It is established that when some attributes refer to one object and one injunction, it should be supported that all the attributes qualify one object only.

It is not that he loves her face only and hates her other limbs. It is not possible to discard some parts and accept some other parts of a person. So one should accept something or reject it in its entirety. For example, by following the Agamas faithfully, one may reach God but by following the words of Buddha, one contradicts that.

अहिकुण्डलन्यायः If one looks at a serpent, it appears to be one serpent only. But when one looks at it from distributive angles like its colour, coil, hood and the like, it appears with difference. It is one from the point of view of 'serpent ness' but it appears in various forms, considering its hood, coil etc. The maxim has basis of the unitary and distributive point of view. The Brahman appears one, but when looked at from different point of view, it has multifarious forms.

Cămīkara' means gold. Secondarily any golden ornament is called Cámikara! It also means golden chain put around the neck. A stupid person has no idea about the golden chain, he has put on. Similarly, a person, though Brahman from the ultimate point of view, does not realize it, owing to ignorance only. A teacher can inake him realize it. Though Brahman is indirectly realized through understanding, the real nature of the individual soul; the self as it were is not realized owing to the influence of Māyā. It is the advice 
of the preceptor which advises him to realize it inwardly. 130. codichtugeira:

cause. 134. Doch att: 
A ball when pressed down with force, jumps up, as it is its nature. It does not get pressed even though we apply full force on it. Following this, the maxim suggests that even if a good man is suppressed or denigrated, he is not affected by it. He attains his original position 
by his good and virtuous deeds. 135. 19 urteet: 
There is an injunction in the Brāhmanas that the Kapiñjala birds should be sacrificed but the number of these birds is not mentioned. This doubt arises because the word Kapiñjala is used in plural.

form determines the meaning of the word.

But this indication of finding a lucky, auspicious star should be obviously considered before the actual shaving otherwise that ascertaining of the auspicious star will be purposeless after the actual hair cutting as the merits and demerit of the bridegroom should be considered before the actual marriage takes place. It is useless afterwards.

This maxim is used to describe a miser, (a greedy person) who neither gives money to the needy nor uses it for his own pleasures. This miser does not use his wealth for others nor does he use it for his own benefit. Such wealth however, is generally stolen away by the thieves or lost in his presence. When a thing does not help the bearer, is practically lost before him. In this situation the man becomes helpless in spite of 
having plenty of wealth. 198. ThanTeRIIT: 
A squint eyed person looks at a point. But it appears that he is looking at some other point. This maxim is 
applicable to any such delusive appearance. 199. sanitari:

The ketaki flower attracts everybody by its sweet fragrance. But men are afraid of plucking it, as they are afraid of the thorny sheath. The maxim states that the attractive things are difficult to be obtained because of some danger involved in approaching or obtaining them, as the people attracted by the precious jewels in the ocean take a deep dive but they are afraid of the 
dangerous, poisonous raptiles into it. 200. Haifa TT: 
Cf. iconus 6.35 Kaidarika is a farmer. He provides irrigation facility to a particular part of the farm. After providing sufficient 
Laukikanycīyakosa 
53 
water to it, he closes it and turns the water to the unirrigated part. In shot, he manages to supply water to the entire farm. So also, says this maxim, the detachment starts from the mind and by continuous adherence to it, it spreads through out the body and then the Yogin witnesses a stream of detchment for his 
ultimate good. 201. uforira: 
कैमुत्वेनार्थसंसिद्धिः काव्यार्थपत्तिरिष्यते। 
स जितस्त्वन्मुखेनेन्दुः का वार्ता सरसीरुहाम्॥ 'Kimuta' is used in the sense of What more needs to be said?' It is also used as follows:-how can the lesser persons dare do something which the eminent persons cannot do? This is also called Kävyārthāpatti. This maxim can also be used to describe a situation when a 
particular meaning is not conveyed by individual means. 202. TUTTET: 
In the days of yore, there were many ways of torturing a suspected criminal in which, making the culprit drink poison was one of the ways which is mentioned in this 
maxim. 203. 00477217A: 
This maxim tells about a drunkard who asserts that he drinks liquor in the house only. He does not drink anywhere outside. This stealthy method of developing 
vices is indicated by this maxim. 204. Intatartti RITAT: 
Cf. THYET HERITA:, ofurchtaturita: Karna who was actually the son of Kunti, thought that 
54 
Laukikanyayakosa 
he was the son of Rādhā as he did not know about the secret of his birth. But when he came to know the truth about his birth, he really became the son of Kunti. On this the present maxim is based and it is applied 10 the fact that the concept that body is soul, vanishes and one come to know the reality by virtue of the advice of 
the teacher. 205. fourguefchet 2174:

(ii) He helps sustaining the world. 206. ATETATUTARITI: 
Flies cling to the injured part of a person from which blood and flesh are exposed. Injured part itself is painful and when the flies cling to the exposed part, it becomes more painful and unbearable. This way of attacking a person on his weak points is the tendency of the wicked. This is what the maxim indicates, 
-HỊo 752 207. STATTRIBE: 
If salt is sprinkled on a sore, the pain becomes unbearable. This maxim suggests the cruel method of inflicting injuries on the already injured (mostly 
mentally). 208. LitigrefTRITI:

Cf. दुधाने तोड भाजले की ताक सुद्दा फुकून पितात (Marathi) If a man's tongue gets scalded by sipping boiled milk, he becomes fearfully cautious and drinks buttermilk also by blowing air into it to make it cool. A man be comes overcautious when he suffers from some painful 
happening. 209. infraria: 
The maxim tells that the original nature of a man cannot be changed by some artificial external device, as the bitterness of the Neem tree will not be diminished even 
if milk is poured to its roots instead of water. 210. Tart: 
Ex. I FE AT HIGT OAST 311 asferta: 11 
-37797511-721HT177 VI.28 This milk water maxim says that when milk and water get mixed, they become inseparable. So when things and concepts are mixed or blended together inseparably, they indicate “Samkara”. But when two things like dal and rice are mixed, they can be separated. This separ able mixture is called “Samsrşti”. They are together 
like the incarnation of Narasimha. 211, airfaranfhairah RII: 
Visnu once slept in the ocean of milk. There was no derth of milk for Him. But how unlucky it would be if he had to roam about in search of milk in the times of difficulty. Similarly, how unlucky will he be if a man has to move about in search of something which is 
found in abundance in his place? 212. agitato2174: 
A sword is kept in a scabbard when it is not in use. If 
56 
Laukikanyayakosa 
a man runs away in fear, looking at an empty scabbard, he will be called the stupid coward. This maxim describes a man who feels frightened by some 
external appearance of danger. 213. afugatrap : 
The maxim states that even if a branch of a tree gives way, sprouts are seen growing from the place from which it is broken. Similarly, if a good or prosperous man loses something, it does not require much time 
for him to recover. 
214, aqarT: 
The flower of the sky is a fictitous notion. This maxim 
thereby, is applied to an impossible, non-existing thing! 215. w19arip: 
Cf. trifarurata: This maxim hints at a wonderful and an astonishing situation and at the same time an impossible and an unimaginable thing in which a horse may be converted 
into an ass or vice versa. 216. augu-18: 
*Kharī' means a vessel made of wood or stone. The maxim originates from a legend. A milk vender used to carry milk into two vessels, hanging on both the sides of the bamboo, and carrying the stick on his shoulders. Later he used to get one pot-full of milk only. So he tied a stone of equal weight on the other side of the stick. When the people asked him about the stone, he said if he carried only one vessel, he may lose the habit of carrying the weight of two pots. Moreover, the milk pot does not shake. All this shows 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
57 
that the milk vender had to face misfortune of carrying the weight of the stone also without any advantage. 
The maxim aims at this profitless act, 217. खरीविषाणन्यायः 
The maxim aims at an impossible or an improbable 
matter like a female ass possessing horns. 218. खलेकपोतन्यायः 
Ex. वृद्धा युवानः शिशवः कपोता: खले यथामी युगपत् पतन्ति। 
तथैव सर्वे युगपत्पदार्थाः परस्परेणान्वयिनो भवन्ति। The maxim takes its origin from an incident. Pigeons see some grains on the ground of the field. All the pigeons alight on the field together and not individually or separately. Similarly, the words in a sentence convey the meaning of the sentence as a whole and not individually. This maxim also describes the events when many causes bring about one and the same effect. It is also the basis of the figure of speech called Samuccaya.

___-भर्तृहरि नीतिशतकम्, 91 The maxim is based on one incident. A bald-headed person takes shelter under the shade of a Bilva tree, as he was tired after a long journey. But unfortunately, a ripe Bilva fruit falls on his head and his head breaks. This shows that an unlucky man faces trouble wherever 
58 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
he goes. His bad luck does not leave him. Detailed explanation of this maxim is given in a verse in 
Nītiśataka of Bhartshari. 220. TITTARITET: 
Flower of the sky is an impossible, improbable thing, It is only an imaginative idea. It is quite impossible in reality. When some impossible thing is to be indicated, 
this maxim is used. 221. TATTGERTE: 
This maxim tells about the lotus in the sky which is 
also an impossible, improbable thing. #TO 715 222. TECK: 
Cf. feferte: The word 'Ghață' means a herd or a group of elephants and hence the word 'Gaja' meaning elephant is not necessary. Such words are redundant. This maxim refers 
to such redundant usages. 223. T AIGI PRITET: 
Ex. देवी: कामयमानस्य चक्रे गजनिमीलिकाम्। 
-- TarifiTuTt 6.721 
When an elephant does not want to see something which is in front of it, it closes its eyes. According to this maxim, closing the eyes suggests indifference or 
feigning not to see anything. 224. TETRA: 
The town of the Gandharvas is purely an imaginery, non-existent concept. This maxim is applicable to all such non-existent concepts.

If some bitter medicine is to be administered, some sweet thing like sugar or jaggery, is put on the tongue of the patient. The maxim based on this practice suggests that bitter things or thoughts can be made palatable by 
serving sweet things or thoughts. 226. TEHTARIRA: 
The maxim says that the cat (domestic cat) moves happily in the house but the elephant has to roam outside. It is tied outside the house. Even then, the elephant gets more respect than the cat which is, living happily inside 
the house. 227. Titter: 
If the buffalo milk is mixed with the cowmilk, there will not be any effect on cow milk. On the contrary, the entire milk becomes good and pious. Similarly good things are not affected by their contact with bad 
things. 228. attraçarita: 
If cow's milk which is considered to be very sacred and pious, is kept in a bag made of dog's skin, it will be certainly contaminated. So also, declares the maxim, that a man of spotless character might be affected, even to a certain extent, by keeping company with the 
man of bad character. 229. MARITT: 
A cow and a Gavaya (a wild buffalo) appear to be the same externally but the difference between the two can be noticed in their milk. The maxim tells us that the things which appear to be similar outwardly are not the same.

-ब्रह्मसूत्र, शाङ्करभाष्य, 3.3.42 The maxim refers to the act of milking a cow which is only an incidental event. Thus it indicates that somethings are related to some matters only casually 
and not essentially or generically. 231. गोपगृहिणीन्यायः

Due to the excessive love for her lover, she killed the king by giving poison and ran to her paramour. When she came there, she was shocked to see her lover dead due to snake bite. Out of disappointment, she left the town and became a harlot in the adjoining place. One day, her own son, sufficiently grown up by that time, approached her. He recogized his mother and in a

mood of penitence, threw himself in the burning fire. The harlot mother too threw herself into the river out of sorrow but was rescued by a cowherd boy whom she married later. But while selling the milk, she fell down and broke the pot. She had, thus, to face a series of calamities. The maxim points out the series of dangers which a man, lacking discretion, has to face.

The order in the first part is sufficient, as Gau (in masculine gender) means bullock also. The combined use of 'Go' and Balivarda, however, particularly emphasizes that the bull should also be brought. The limitation of the meaning to 'bull' is done by the combined use of co? and 'Ea arc..

Cf. घटसूर्यबिम्बन्यायः If a lamp is placed inside a big jar, it illumines almost the entire part of the jar. Similarly, suggests the maxim that the man of knowledge (or wisdom) spreads his knowledge, though he may not remain in the light of publicity. This maxim can be explained thus. The influence of a person may have limited sphere as the lamp in the jar spreads light inside the entire part of 
the jar only. 243. घटारोहणन्यायः

When the water-wheel rotates, the jars attached to it, go on moving up and down. The empty jars are filled with water from the well and those filled with water are emptied when they come up. This emptying and filling of the jars continue till the water-wheel rotates. This kind of situation is seen in man's life also. Happiness and sorrow, richness and poverty (emptiness) go on interchanging with each other. No state is

ननु स्फोटव्यञ्जकतापक्षोऽपि प्रागुक्ताविकल्पप्रसरेण घटकुटीप्रभातयितमिति चेत्, तदेतत् मनोराज्यादि जृम्भणम्। This maxim is based on the event "Dawn at the toll gate”. A driver drives his vehicle in a round about way, through lanes and bylanes in order to avoid the payment of toll amount. He goes on travelling like that in his vehicle and finally in the morning reaches a place which was nothing but the toll gate only. When a man tries consciously to avoid a particular thin: unluckily, he has to face the same event, even after his

conscious endeavour to avoid it. This maxim applies to 
such situations. 248. CERU: 
The woric. ife cannot be ugined with only one either a husband or a wife. Both are necessary for creation and for keeping the wheel of life moving. The maxim suggests this principle by giving the example of a grinding stone. Grinding takes place only with the help of two stones- one moving stone and the other a 
steady one. 249. FUTTERITAT:

or accidentally 250. Errangiatoitet: 
Ghịta means ghee, Kośātaki is a type of gourd. The compound word means a gourd with ghee inside. But actually there is no ghee inside that fruit or vegetable. The word is a misnomer.

If water is sprinkled on burn injury, that will develop some sores on the burnt parts, Ghee is also a type of liquid. But when it is sprinkled on the wound, the burning sensation of the wound is not only reduced but no sores also come up. Ghee actually helps in healing the wound. So apparently, when things which appear malevolent, actually help the growth or healing. 
This is the purport of this maxim. 252. घोटकब्रह्मचारिन्यायः 
A horse behaves like a detached passionless animal as long as it does not come across a mare (a female horse). But once it sees, it runs after the mare. Some people observe celibacy so long as they are away from the women. When they come across a damsel, they get lured by her. This restricted celibacy is the 
import of this maxim. 253. चक्रनाभिन्यायः

Though he withdraws the stick after some time, the momentum of the wheel continues. This maxim, based on this phenomenon, tells us that the original impressions or Sarnskaras persist though the external circumstances

These two birds move about happily together in the day time. But at the advent of the night both are separated. They move about through out the night in search of each other and cry piteously. These cakravāka 
birds are taken to be the ideal pair of lovers, 256. चक्षुर्दीपन्यायः

Brahman, only one, i.e. Vịttivyāpti (the conscious feeling that I am the Brahman') is enough. The enlightenment does not expect any semblance of 
consciouseness (Cidābhāsa). 257. ETXT: STAURAU: 
The eyes of a serpent serve the purpose of the ears too. A serpent does the work of hearing and seeing simultaneously, with the same organ. This maxim is generally applicable to serpents only but it can be applied to a person who does the work of observing 
and listening at a time skilfully. 258. GUSTTORICHTRITT: 
A king who had married a cândala lady, was riding on an elephant along with his spouse. The king got down from the elephant only to greet a sage respectfully. The cāļala lady thought that the sage is highly respectable and began to walk with him. The sage, on the way, stopped to pay obeissance to lord Siva. The lady, then, sat in the temple only. After some time, a dog came there and eased itself on the shrine of Siva. When the dog began to loiter around the cāņdala lady, she thought that the caņdala is superior to all. The maxim suggests that the people come back to their original nature, even after taking efforts for sustaining 
superior positions. 259. Edoarametre: 
This maxim refers to an anecdote. It is a custom to offer some charity to a person who knows (i.e. has mastered) the four vedas. A person approached a wealthy man and solicited charity from him, pleading that he knows that the number of vedas is four. This was clearly 
Laukikanyayakosa 
an act of cheating. Similarly, if a person knows and mutters some words, related to the Brahman, cannot 
be taken to be the knower of the Brahman. 260. चतुर्दूहन्यायः

(i-e. heart) with its existence is felt in the entire body. 264. चन्द्रचकोरन्यायः 
The bird called cakora eagerly waits for the rising of the moon, as it drinks the rays of the moon only. It does not eat anything except the rays of the moon. If some body waits for some particular person anxiously, 
this maxim is used. 265. चन्द्रज्योत्स्नान्यायः

The moon has offered the moonlight to the entire world and so she has become pale and dark. The blackish, dark moon does not appear pleasing. According to this maxim, even a beautiful object may not be considered appealing and beautiful all the time.

If fragrant flowers are wrapped in a piece of cloth, the cloth gives out fragrance for some time, owing to its contact with the sweet, fragrant flowers, though the flowers are taken away. Similarly, says the maxim that one can imbibe certain good qualities in the company 
of the great people. 268. afactedURITAT: 
The maxim refers to the rumination of something which is already ruminated. Thus it suggests the repetition of 
the same thing again and again. 269. alkahoitusteita: 
It is the nature of the Cātaka bird to drink that water only which falls from the clouds i-e.rain water. Even though there is plenty of water on the earth, this bird does not dare to look at it. It quenches its thirst by the rainwater only. It is its nature. The maxim describes the nature of certain persons as quite natural, though it 
may appear to be queer. 270. चालनीन्यायः 
When a sieve is used, it drops the flour down and retains the chaff into the sieve. Taking clue from the fact that the sieve accepts the chaff and drops out the good grains or flour. The maxim describes the mentality of some persons of this type.

272. FITT-011: 
Before drawing a picture, the artist spreads some white paint on the canvas. Then he draws some lines on it and then applies various colours to the picture. Similarly, the God appears to be consciousness or God. Then He becomes an indweller and finally bears a virāț figure.

Similarly, the nectar pot or the fire, painted in a picture, are unable to show their effects. The present maxim, based on these examples, suggests that the actions performed by an enlightened person does not show any result. Thus the actions performed by an enlightened 
person do not cling to him. 274. feftaiçao CRTA: 
It will be ridiculous if a jackal tries to imitate a panther or a tiger. The jackal tries to adore its body with various colours and thus tries to imitate a tiger. The maxim thus ridicules the attempt of low persons who try to imitate the greatmen externally.

-सर्वदर्शनसङ्ग्रह, पृ० 73; सा० 123 This maxim alludes to a legend. Once some thieves stole some precious articles from the royal palace. The police began to chase them. Being afraid of the royal police, they threw away those things near the sage Māndavya who was silently practising penance. The police thought that the sage had stolen the things and produced the sage before the king who sentenced hiin to death. This maxim tells that even good and innocent

prominent principal aspect. 277. छागपशुन्यायः 
This maxim refers to the semantic law of contraction where meanings of some words are contracted in certain contexts. In Sanskrit ('Fasu') animal means all animals including an ox but in Vedic language, the meaning of this word animal (Pasu) is contracted. It means only a 
goat, especially one which is offered in a sacrifice.

In Sanskrit, there are two types of pun-Sabhanga and Abhanga. In Sabhanga type, one word is closely connected with the other word (but in different sense). That is when the two are glued together like lac and

Once a fox ate a fruit of the tree "Casula fistula”. Owing to that its stomach started aching. Then it decided not to touch that fruit again. But as soon as the stomach-ache reduced, the jackal went in search of that fruit and ate it again. This maxim illustrates the 
uncontrolled longing of a greedy person. 283. orrtäranlupra:

When breezes blow over the surface of water, many billows are formed, together with foam and the like. Though they appear to be different, they contain the

Staract 2014: 
Jalatumbikā is a pumpkin like fruit which floats on the water so long as the mud applied to it remains intact. But it sinks in the water when the mud is washed away. Similarly, says the maxim, that a man can sustain himself as long as he has some supporting base. When it disappears he sinks.

When oil is poured on the boiling water, the boiling water becomes cool and calm. Similarly, the wrath of an angry man can be removed by sweet, affectionate words. This is the spirit of this maxim.

If a drop of oil is poured on the water, it spreads all over the water, but a drop of ghee gets solidified in the same place. This expansion and contraction of the two

-चाणक्यनीति 12.19 If the water falls down drop by drop from some place, it may fill a big pitcher also. Even though the drop of water is very small, if it falls continuously, it is possible to fill up a big jar with that water. Similarly, the great tasks show a small beginning but these small things 
may lead to the magnificent ends-says the maxim. 291. जलमन्थनन्यायः 
The maxim decries the futile attempt of churning the water. If milk or curd is churned, we get butter but if water is churned, a person does not get anything. It will result in fruitless, tiresome effort. This maxim 
applies to such useless, futile efforts of the person. 292. जलमौक्तिकन्यायः

into a pearal. 293. जलाक्षरन्यायः 
It will be futile for a person to draw some lines on the 
Laukikanyāyakosa

water. The water. unlike a paper or a canvas is not suitable for writing. The maxim suggests that proper 
basis or substratum is necessary for doing anything. 294, ETTEIT: 
The fire and the water are two contradictory things in nature. They cannot stay together. When they come together forcibly, the stronger one wins and the weaker one has to perish. Similarly, two enemies cannot stay together for a long time. The destruction of one of them is certain. The inferior or the weaker has to face 
a defeat and ultimately he has to die. 295. PMIT R RITIT: 
When one work is to be done, it is taken for granted that the ancillaries are taken care of. For example, when somebody is asked to bring water, he is not

The maxim informs that the water, the air and the 
firmament are never mutually antagonistic. 297. GIMISTEHT SCRITT: 
This maxim tells about optical illusion. The reflection of the moon is only one in the still water. But numerous reflections are visible in the moving or waving water 
due to optical illusion. 298. TETAPTIT: 
If a leech is placed on the massive breasts of a damsel, it will suck only blood of the breast, instead of the sweet milk in it. Similarly, the wicked person, always looks at the bad things in a person without appreciating his good qualities. They are the fault finders and do

not care to look at the virtues of any person says the 
maxim. 299. FATBOYFRITI:

-- TELE2 5. 54 The water is basically cool only. It becomes hot when heat is applied to it. There is one natural quality in any object and the other quality is either adopted, derived or a temporary attribute. This is the meaning of this 
maxim. 300. जहत्स्वार्थवृत्तिन्यायः 
Sometimes the words give up their expressed meaning (Abhidhārtha). Just as a man working for somebody else, gives up his own work. Similar event takes place in semantic parlance and some secondary meaning becomes prominent. The event is called Jahallakşaņā, in which the function of the word gives up its direct 
meaning. This is the intent of the maxim. 301. Fe Gutenarefaffpirat:

Všttinyāya. 302. Fiaicina: 
Cf. 750rprufa, fa74737 5.220. "Jātakarma' rite is performed as soon as the child is born. This is the first ceremony of the child after his birth.

The maxim suggests that even if the food is prepared mainly for the son-in-law, it can be served for the other 
guests also. Some arguments are advanced in the Brahmasūtra to refute the doctrine of the Samkhyas that the cause of the world is Pradhāna. According to this maxim, the arguments can be utilized for refuting the same Pradhāna doctrine of the Yogic theorists.

so that the pressure of grief would be reduced. 310. HUGOT HURTT37: 
When rice is properly prepared, one can eat it with pleasure. But if it is not well-cooked, one has to eat the half-cooked rice only. The maxim suggests that one has to deal with the situation as it is.

But once he was caught red handed, stealing some articles in the kitchen. This shows that the tendency to do some thing beyond ones scope or 
capacity ultimately ruins a person. 323. VICTOTT-ret: 
A palmyra trce grows tall but it can never give good shadow to the travellers. The fruits of this tree also grow on such a height that the passers by cannot pluck and eat them. Similarly, a person may be occupying a high position like the tall, great palmyra tree. But he is of no use for his fellowmen who seek shelter or help from him. What is the use of his greatness? The maxim describes people, who are great but useless for the 
society. 324. NICHORATO: 
If a serpent wants to eat a fruit of the palmyra tree, it cannot do so because the knots of the tree are bent upwards and as such it cannot climb. Moreover, the belly of the serpent is likely to be torn while climbing it. This maxim thus advises that one should not go to a place, fraught with danger, to obtain some fruit.

swallows it swiftly. 327. Fantara: 
Generally, when people visit the places of pilgrimage, they take bath in the sacred water of the river there. A crow, however, takes dip in the same sacred river many a time without knowing that the dip is meritorious. This maxim suggests that some people are not equipped

This maxim is based on a funny story where the loss is supposed to have been reverted to the complainer. Four persons, engaged in the business of cotton, had domesticated a cat. They tried to fasten small bells to its foot, when it was injured. They bandaged the leg but it caught fire. The cat ran with the burning bandage towards the heap of cotton and the entire cotton bales were burnt. When the merchants sought justice, the judge declared that the cat cannot walk towards the heap of cotton and so the three other merchants who were not involved in tying the bells, should pay the 
compensation. 341, GTE FRITU: 
The maxim maintains that when the ignorance is removed, the mundane world also is annulled, as the burnt seeds do not germinate.

TETTET POTAT: 
Cf. ZTETETT: When a three-plied rope is burnt, the shape of the three plies remains as it is. The appearance is false, as the rope is completely burnt down. So also maintains

-काव्यप्रकाश V. The fire which burns fuel, extinguishes automatically in the absence of fuel, and abandons its special state of flame. So also, when the mental functions are curbed, the inner apparatus is calmed down in pure Sattva state. The maxim tells that with the disappearance of Vịttis or mental functions, only the Sattva quality 
survives. 344. दण्डसर्पमारणन्यायः 
When a person sees a serpent, he tries to find a stick to strike at it. But instead of the stick, he comes across an axe and his efforts to find out a stick go waste. This maxim describes a situation when a thing which could have been obtained without any effort, is obtained with effort.

Once some cakes were affixed to a stick. A person brought the news that the stick was eaten by a mouse. The eating up of a stick conveys that the cakes have also been eaten, the maxim based on this incident shows that when something is destroyed, things associated 
with it are also supposed to have been destroyed. 346. afus ry: 
Cf. JEITA: 
Some persons, walking on the street, carry sticks in their hand and some of them do not have sticks with them. Still the group is termed as "the one carrying 
stick" 347. gferite : 
Milk is transformed into curds. This change is "transfor mation". But the change of rope into a serpent is false and so it is called false change (i.e. Vivarta). The Advaita Vedāntins believe that the worldly phenomenon is a false change (i.e. Vivarta).

This maxim describes the natural love between the husband and the wife. Sometimes it appears that there is no love lost between them, especially when they quarrel bitterly but ultimately both of them display their 
mutual love. 349. quurufafara: 
Ex. 377fafa mitant mifagaria BALI 
__ बहिर्वन्मायया भाति दर्पणे प्रतिबिम्बवत्॥ The worldly phenomenon of the world is reflected in the Brahman, as objects are reflected in the mirror.

350. augurariichtIT: 
The mirror gives the exact and correct reflection of a thing. If the thing is ugly or dirty, the reflection will be ugly but if it is beautiful, it will give beautiful reflection. 
This is the meaning of this maxim. 351. Gatarara: 
A spoon is placed in a vessel, containing some soup for taking it out and serving. The spoon is in contact with the soup or curry for a long time; but it cannot relish the taste of the soup. So also, an ignorant man cannot learn or know anything, even though he is 
surrounded by books or learned men. 352, gyerdacht: 
This maxim is based on a legend. Ten stupid fellows went on a journey. At one place, one of them began to count his co-travellers. He counted them (barring himself) and complained that somebody was missing. Another person started counting in the same manner and complained that one of them was left behind. Another traveller came there and counted them ten fellows, as all of them forgot to count themselves. A third man, a learned wise person was required to tell them that they were ten. This implies that only a wise 
preceptor can give proper guidance. 353. 
G rat: 
See sit, aferata, 23-28 Cf. Frufra fade, ço 81. The maxim tells that he who observes a vow on the tenth day of the bright half of Jyeștha month, gets rid of all the sins. When many profits are gained with one act, this maxim is used.

This maxim tells us that it is possible to spend one rupee more that is eleven rupees if a person is willing to spend ten rupees. Or it also means that the expenditure on the eleventh person can be adjusted in the calculated 
expenditure of ten persons. 355. ZhotoCRTA: 
Ex. GHANCERIT FAT ASPTT TEGI 
भीमभासदृढन्यायो नित्यमस्तु तवानद्य॥ 
afhos 4.34.36 This maxim is based on a legend. A demon called Sambara created three demons called Dāma, Vyāla and Kata, out of his magical power. They had the power of pounding down mountains like Meru with only the palms of their hands. But they were born in the category of mosquitos as a result of their ignorance. This shows that stupid fellows may attain high positions but 
ultimately their ignorance leads them to their ruin. 356. Gray TriTU: 
This maxim alludes the delusion in which a wooden 
figure of a man is mistaken to be a real man. 357, foarte 4112: 
The moon-light is bright and pleasant in the night but her light appears to be dim and lusterless in the day time. Referring to this phenomenon, the maxim conveys the idea that a man of less qualities or brilliance does 
not shine in the presence of a brilliant man. 358. fare : 
The owl cannot see anything in the daylight. It hates the sun-light which is useful and beneficial to other beings. The maxim based on this fact, says that the mean persons dislike the good and virtuous persons.

In this maxim kalikā signifies a flame, resembling a bud. Though small like a bud in the beginning a flame can spread sufficient light everywhere. Similarly, a man who is young in age but great or big in merits, may 
have tremendous fame in the world. 360, CETURTA: 
मलिनीकुर्वन्नर्जुनवर्त्म मदीभवति राधेयः। यदि ताडनादि लभते तथापि तच्छील एव खलः॥ There are many common characteristics between an ass and a wicked man. Both of them are capable of amassing wealth and both of them become intoxicated by it. Both of them become excited in the month of Āșādha and do not change their way of life, though 
they receive good thrashing 361. guft491cRpA: 
The maxim brings out the resemblance between a wicked person and a mosquito. Both of them attack 
the human beings and trouble them. 362. UARITAT: 
The maxim tells that the mountains appear to be fascinating from a long distance only. If we go near them, all the big stones, valleys and dark forests are visible and make us frighten. They look pleasant from a distance only. So also, the persons appear to be good from a distance. The more one tries to go near 
them, the more he is disillusioned. 363. greatefronteira: 
The maxim suggests that the two trees appear to be the same or one from a long distance. The difference between them is not grasped properly from a distance.

364. cafum : 
The roots of grass spread deep into the earth. They are not seen apparently but with the rainfall, the sprouts of little delicate green grass come up from the ground. The things may not be visible from outside but if their roots have gone deep down like the grass, they do not die. The maxim based on this phenomenon suggests that principles are too deep to be examined by their 
external appearance. 365. TESCRITAT: 
Ex. एवं दृष्टिसृष्टिन्यायेनास्मत्कल्पितोऽव्ययं वियदादिप्रपञ्चोऽ

-HO 918 The creator creates the world of sentient and insentient beings but all that world gets dissolved in the night of the creator i.e.Brahmā. It appears again when the day of Brahmā rises- All the creation is thus appearance 
and disappearance in the day and night of Brahma. 366. Taarfechtute RTE 
Some scholars maintain that many scriptural statements describe the image of the deities. Actually, the image form is not natural. It is superimposed on deities. But it can be argued that though some statements underline the devotion to the deities, the implied meaning can be proved to be the real one, in accordance with 
the maxim of Devatādhikaraņa. 367. dag Tigitefamat: 
Devadatta's fame as a brave hero is limited to a particular town in which he is living. Others, living out side that town may not have any idea about his bravery. A person

of heroic quality is recognized somewhere and

-पतञ्जलि, व्याकरणमहाभाष्य, 1.1.57 This maxim is based on a small event. When Devadattal is killed, he cannot be rejuvenated, even though his 
assasins are arrested and given death sentence. 369. देवदत्तापुत्रन्यायः 
When someone remarks that a particular person is the son of Devadatta, it also implies that he is the son of his wife also. The maxim says that the son belongs to both-the mother and the father but the father is given more importance, so his name is taken and not the 
name of the mother. 370. देवरन्यायः 
A childless man may utilize the services of his brother or brother-in-law, to get a child from his wife. The maxim based on this idea, states that a man may go to 
any extreme to get his wish fulfilled. 371. 'देहकेशन्यायः

or its attribute illumines the entire sentence. 373. देहाधोमुखन्यायः 
Cf. आकाशपरिच्छन्नन्यायः A man suffering from rheumatic disease, hangs his head down. But when that disease (disappears) is cured, he becomes a normal man and sits erect. So also, the physical diseases from the body, disappear when their cause becomes extinct. 
374. द्राविडप्राणायामन्यायः 
The maxim refers to a practice, prevalent among the. Dravid people. While practising breath control (Prāņā yāma), they hold the nose with the hand in a round about way instead of holding it directly from the front facing. This generally refers to the habit of some people 
who take a long, round about way of doing any work. 375. धनञ्जय न्यायः

leaves off the chaff. 378. धारावाहिकबुद्धिन्यायः

This maxim is based on a legend. Once a king ordered his barber to go around the city and find out a handsome boy. He came across many handsome boys but he thought that they were just like his own son. That boy was actually very black and ugly looking, He took his son to the king, thinking the king would like the boy. The king became furious. The barber argued and said that he could not find such a handsome boy in the entire three worlds. The king was convinced by the fact that one loves one's own possessions, however 
ugly they may be! 403. Pichluchichte: 
Once a crow was perching on the mast of a boat in the ocean. The ship or the boat started sailing. When the crow felt the movement of the ship, it was frightened and began to fly over the sea. But there was not a single tree where it could perch on and so it returned to the same mast again. So also, the individual self inay transmigrate anywhere but it has firm basis in the

When there is sufficient cloth at our disposal, we can make a (cotton cloth) cottage or a (cotton cloth) tent out of it. The maxim based on this observation, shows that any task can be accomplished when adequate

There are leaves and sometimes fruits also on the tree. The leaves of the tree fade away and fall down on the ground. But by the falling of the leaves, the fruits are not spoiled. Similarly, a few men may have some defect or drawback, but it does not mean that all men are full 
of defects. This is what the maxim wants to suggest. 415. ofera AUTRITI: 
Once a person saw a serpent, entering his house. The man was frightened and wanted to kill it. But he was in a dilemma and was puzzled because had he killed it, it would have resulted in a sin and if he kept quiet, the danger arising out of the serpent would have been unmitigated. He thought upon a device. He requested a passer-by to kill the serpent, so that the possible sin and the danger arising out of the serpent, would accrue to that passer by-instead of him. The maxim suggests that everyone in this world wants to 
save his life by hook or by crook. 416. UGARITAT:

-भगवद्गीता 5-10; सा० 807 This maxim is based on the phenomenon of some water drops on a lotus-leaf. These water-drops do not last for a long time on the lotus leaf. They suggest the following points:--- (1) All creation is transitory. (2) The company of the great, though temporary, is 
always benevolent. The water-drops on the lotus leaf, though temporary, shine like pearls so long as they remain on the leaf. All worldly contacts are momentary. Similarly a man of well balanced intellect or a man of mental and physical control lives in the world 
with complete detachment. 418. पनसोदुम्बरादिवदितिन्यायः

-Heeft, ifasih, 47 The length of a shadow of a thing is less in the earlier part of the day; while it is longer in the later part of the day. It is short in the afternoon but gradually it increases in the latter part of the day. The maxim opines that the friendship with the good people is longer and stable after some days though it seems shorter in the early days. In contrast to this, the friendship with the wicked appears to be longer or close in the beginning but becomes shorter or less as the time passes.

-सर्वदर्शनसङ्ग्रह, पाणिनिप्रकरण This maxim is based on the fact that the rain falls equally everywhere, whether water accumulates at a particular place or not. The rain falls with equal quantity of water at all places. This maxim is also applied to the functioning of the Almighty. The grace of God is uniformly bestowed on all beings. But its effects are seen diversely, owing to the Karmas (past deeds) of the recepients, as the rain-water, fallen on the fertile land, helps to germinate the seeds but becomes ineffective when fallen on the barren land.

So long as a person hears the stories or discourses on Purānas, he feels detachment towards the worldly happiness and temporary existence in the world.

बादरायणसम्बन्धो यूयं यूयं वयं वयम्॥ (लोकोक्तिः) This maxim speaks about the habit of some person who tries to establish some far fetched relation with somebody (with a view to derive some advantage from him). Any man who has a wheel made of Badara wood in his house, establishes relation with somebody, simply because he had planted a Badara tree in his (house) garden. Once two persons accidently met each other at one place. One person said to the other. “You have a Bădarī tree in your house. The wheels of my cart are also made of Bädarī wood. So we are related and there is Badarayana (i.e. irrational, arbitrary) relation between us". This is how absolutely unrelated persons try to establish fantastic relation with other for their selfish end.

The maxim refers to some unfortunate plight of a person. A bald-headed man was travelling from a forest. He was tired. So he stood under the shade of a Bilva tree to take rest. Unfortunately, a ripe Bilva fruit fell on his head and his head was broken. An unfortunate person has to face trouble and difficulty wherever he goes. His misfortune does not leave him 
anywhere. 483, famcaftitat : 
The maxim maintains that the doctrine propounded by the rival persons cannot be refuted, if the doctrine is not known perfectly, with its pros and cons. A Godhā,a big lizard, lives in a hole but it is not seen always living in a hole. So it cannot be taken as a differentiating feature, owing to the ignorance of its behavioural 
characteristic. 484. Farmafavo : 
The maxim condemns the practice of giving one's views about unknown matters, like trying to know about a Bilva fruit ( about which nothing is known earlier), 
only by breaking it. 485. autorITA:

But when the word mendicant Parivrājaka comes as the final word in a compound with the word 'Brāhmaṇa', it means a Brāhmaṇa other than a mendicant. In order to differentiate between the Brāhmaṇas and the mendicants, the compound means the mendicants other than the Brāhmaṇas, as some

A brālimana embraces Buddhism and becomes a Bhikṣu or a Sramanaka. Nevertheless, he is referred to as a Brāhmana owing to his previous state. This maxim is used in the Sāhitya śāstra works to explain the figure of speech called Vyatireka Alarkāra.

A person called Bhadra served a Yakşa ardently. As a result of it, he got a Bhadraghata from the Yakşa which yielded all the desires. Once he served rich delicious food to his relatives and friends.

Bharchu wanted to return to his capital but he got the news of the appointment of another minister. He was disgusted and remained in the forest. When the enemy came to know about it, they told the king that he had become a goblin.

The king summoned the beggar who pleaded that the dog always followed him wherever he went. Because of the fear of the barking dog, no body came near him to give alms. So he bet it. The dog, in return pleaded that it was a worshipper in a temple, in its earlier birth. It used to eat the food prepared for the deity and Brāhmaṇas. He accepted the punishment and requested the king lo appoint the beggar as a worshipper of the temple. Then the dog went to Kāśi and died there.

charity in rich, prosperous life. 538. Hacamat: 
When many persons sit together for food, they put the morsels of food in their mouth by taking them in their hands. If a cat is observing this, it thinks that the persons are taking food in their hands with a view to give it to itself (i.e.cat).

About eleven Miāṁsās are mentioned below. होलिकाधिकरणन्याय, वानियमन्याय, दर्वीहोमन्याय, वाक्यार्थप्रति पत्तिन्यायं, अङ्गणनिषेधेतारदर्ष्यादितिन्याय, पशुसोमार धीकरणन्याय, निषादस्थपतिन्याय, प्रतिप्रदानं गुण आवर्तनीयं इतिन्याय, गुणविरोध न्याय। 
Somemore Mîmāmsā maxims are enumerated, on pp. 1339 & 1354 in Vol.-V, Part-II, History of Dharmasāstra.

544. मुजादिषीकोद्धरणन्यायः 
Ex. (1) यथा मुञ्जादिषीकैवमात्मा युक्त्या समुद्धृतः। 
शरीरत्रितयाद् धीरैः परब्रह्मैवे जायते। 
-पञ्चदशी, 1; तत्त्वविवेक, 42 (2) अङागुण्ठमात्रः पुरुषोऽन्तरात्मा सदा जनानां हृदये 
सन्निविष्टः। तं स्वाच्छरीरात्प्रवृहेन्मुञ्जदिवैषीकां धैर्येणं तं विद्याच्छुक्रममृतम्॥ 
--कठोपनिषद् 6.17 In the inner side of the Muñjā grass, there is a thread like long and soft grass, resembling a thin tube. That tube like grass can be carefully taken out from the Munjā grass. The maxim , referring to this speciality, tells that the persons observing celibacy, can slowly separate themselves from the three types of bodies. Then the self becomes one with the Brahman which is 
of the nature of consciousness or Bliss. 545. मुण्डितशिरोनक्षत्रान्वेषणन्यायः 
Trying to find an auspicious time for the work already done is useless. The maxim says that it is as useless as the action of a man who first gets his head shaved and then tries to find out any auspicious time, day or moment 
for it. 546. मूषासिक्तताम्रन्यायः 
Ex. मूषासिक्तं यथा तानं तन्निमं जायते तथा। 
रूपादीन् व्याप्नुपच्चित्तं तन्निमं दृश्यते, ध्रुवम्॥ 
-पञ्चदशी, द्वैतविवेक 4, 28 Hot liquid metal is poured in a crucible. That inetal liquid takes some shape when it is cooled down. The maxim describes the process of mind indicating 
150 
Laukikanyayakosa 
that the inner Citta (mind) permeates external forins. It makes them the object of perception and in the end 
takes the shape of the object of perception itself. 547. fechagutaII: 
The maxim is put to use at the time of describing the 
impossible things like the horns of the rat. 548. choufc taita: 
Many things were kept in a box. A serpent also made its entry into it, thinking that it could get some food articles to eat; A rat made a hole to that box and entered it. Seeing the mouse, the snake tried to catch hold of it but the mouse easily escaped through the same hole made by it. Based on this event, the maxim remarks that a being may escape from sorrow to joy 
and vice a versa too. 549. SHIRITT: 
The maxim says that all those things which are spoiled or damaged at the beginning only, perish ulimately as the tree ultimately dies (dries up) when its roots are spoied by the insects. 
550. TC BUTRIRI: 
Ex. 7 fera ferate felt aruit het: 
पारं गमिष्यसि यत्तो भवसागरस्य। पुत्रः कलत्रमितरे सुहृदः सहायाः 
सर्वं विलोकय सखे मृगतृष्णिकामम्। The maxim illustrates the phenomenon of delusion by pointing how the deer try to run after imaginery waves of water, to quench their thirst. Their delusion is sometimes fatal to them-According to Vedānta, this world is also a kind of delusion. 
-NO 442

551, CECRU: 
मृद्धट दव सुरवमेद्यो दुःसधानश्च दुर्जनो भवति। सुजनस्तु कनकघट इव दुर्भेदः सुकरसंधिश्च॥ । 
-Yea, f4-4fa-38 An earthen jar can be fashioned in a short time but it can be broken or destroyed within a short time. A metal jar requires a good deal of time for perparation but it cannot be broken easily. It lasts for a long time. The maxim is applicable to a similar type of friend ship. When it is formed quickly, perishes quickly. But the friendship which is made after a long time, lasts 
long and is never broken easily. 
552. मेघचातकन्यायः 
The maxim describes the real friendship as one which is there between the Cătaka bird and the cloud, The cãtaka takes water from the clouds only and not from anywhere else. 
553. 
TEGRITET: 
Once two rams were fighting with each othet. A jackal intervened and tried to stop them from fighting but alas, it was killed in that confusion. This maxim suggests that when two persons of equal strength are fighting, and if a weak person intervenes in that fight, there is a danger of the loss of his own life. 
554. TTTSTREITT: 
People often try to imitate their king-his merits or demerits. So the maxim declares.As the king, so the subjects. The subjects of the empire follow the foot 
152 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
steps of their king only whether they imitate his virtues or his vices. 
555. यथासङ्ख्यन्यायः 
If there are equal number of subjects and predicates in a sentence, then they are connected in order of their placements i.e first subject with first predicate and so on. That is what this maxim implies by saying 'Yathā samkhya'. For example, you conquer, entertain and endure-an enemy, a friend and the calamity respec 
tively. 556. यदन्तरन्यायः 
The maxim tells about the tendency of the people to consider or to relate the earlier event to the cause of the subsequent one, linking them by causal relation. When a newly wedded bride enters her in-law's house and some good fortune occurs, there it is related to the 
good fortune or good and auspicious entry of the bride. 557. यववराहन्यायः 
Ex. यववराहन्यायःकरणन्यायेन लोकप्रसिद्धिः शास्त्रीयप्रद्धिया 
बाध्येत्याह। 
-आननदगिरिटीका, ब्रह्मसूत्र, शांकरभाध्य II.3.45 The maxim speaks about different connotations of the same words in urban and rural languages, giving the 
example of Yava (barley) and Varāha (a boar). 558. यवागूगर्तप्लवनन्यायः 
युक्ताहारविहारस्य युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्मसु। युक्तस्वप्नावबोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहः॥ 
---गीता, VI.17 Gruel (Yavāgū) in a particular quantity may give pleasure and satisfaction to a person. But how can he 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
153 
get the same joy if he swims in a ditch full of this gruel? The maxim indirectly advises the people to be satisfied with a limited quantity of whatever thing they 
desire. 559. याचितकमण्डनन्यायः 
Ex.अस्याः मुखश्रीप्रतिबिम्बमेव जलाच्च तातान्मुकुराच्चमित्रान्। अभ्यर्थ धत्तः खलु पद्मचन्द्रौ विभूषणं याचितकं कदाचित्॥ 
___-श्रीहर्ष, नैषधीयचरित, 8.56 Some people who have no ornaments of their own, decorate their bodies with borrowed ornaments. This desire for parading oneself in the people, even without 
proper resources is vented out by the maxim. 560. यावत्तैलंतावदाख्यानम्न्यायः 
The religious discourses can go on till there is oil in the lamp. Once it is exhausted, there was darkness and consequently no narration continue. The maxim, on the strength of this event tells that the work can be 
done so long as the means or resources are available. 561. 'यावद्वचनंवाचनिकम्' न्यायः 
Ex. (i) कश्चात्र विशेषः। स यदि वाचनिकस्ततो 
यावद्वचनमेव कर्तव्यः। -तन्त्रवार्तिक, V.3.12. (ii) शाबर भाष्य, मीमांसासूत्र, V.4.11; V.3.12. This maxim is applied to certain conditions in the Sastra literature to those words or statements, in which the words are sufficient enough to express the meaning of the statement. No additional words or explanations are 
required. 562. युध्यत्कुक्कुटन्यायः 
The maxim states that some men go on fighting with 
154 
Laukikanyayakosa 
foolhardiness, like the two cocks which continue to 
fight though they bleed profusely. 563. YATIRITSTAURITA: 
Ex. atai ylat farferd un : 
कश्चिद् गुणो भवति यद्यपि सम्प्रतीह। कुर्यां तथापि सुजनार्थमिदं यतः किं 
यूकाभयेन परिधान विमोक्षणं स्यात्॥ -सुभाषितम् Should one discard a blanket because the bed.bugs or lice in it are likely to bite? Should one not write poems because many uninterested and wicked people are unable to appreciate the poems? This maxim is applicable to a person who wants to give up the benefits, 
simply because some loss is likely to occur. 564, 4974: 
Once the animal is tied to the sacrificial post, its death becomes certain. Similarly, when the early signs are seen, the consequences begin to appear. This is the 
purport of the maxim. 565, TOTYCRTAT: 
When a sentence has no expectancy (for the import) and when no other word is necessary for the proper understanding of the sentence, some expectancy is deliberately created and a consistency of meaning is established. Though thereis- no expetancy in "There is no cloth." But expectancy can be created by the question "of what type”? is suggested by the word "red." There is a cloth can be expanded into there is a red cloth. The maxim incorporates this device. 
- AO 501 566. CHURRA: 
This maxim is based on the false imposition of serpent
﻿Laukikanyāyakosa 
155 
on a rope. This delusion changes due to false imposition called Vivarta. From the abstract Brahman, the multifarious world cannot take its rise. Then what is the phenomenon of the world? Actually, the world is only a false appearance, on the substratum of the Brahman, as there is the false appearance of the serpent on a rope. This example is often repeated in the works 
on Advaita philosophy. 567. रण्डाविवाहन्यायः 
An unchaste woman thinking of marriage! Though astonishing, it should be accepted that an unchaste woman does have passionate feelings but even then, she cannot satisfy her passion with only one man with whom she is wedded. The maxim tells, that is why this 
woman does not think about marriage. 568, रथकाराधिकरणन्यायः 
Ex. आधाने श्रूयते। वर्षासु रथकार आदधीतेति, चेत् नैवम्। 
सङ्कीर्णजातिविशेष रूढत्वात्। वैश्यायां क्षत्रियादुत्पन्नो महिष्यः। शूद्रायां वैश्यादुत्पन्नः करणी। तस्यां करण्यां माहिष्यादुत्पन्नो रथकारः। तथा च याज्ञवल्क्यः । माहिष्येण करण्यां तु रथकारः 
प्रजायते। इति। -जैमिनीयन्यायमाला विस्तार The word Rathakāra means a man fashioning a chariot, a carpenter. But he is not included among the first three Varnas Thus the conventional meaning is stronger than the derivative meaning. This is what is conveyed by the maxim. A child of a Vaiśya lady and a Sudra husband is 'Karani' When a son is born from Karani and a Mähişya husband, he is called a Rathakāra. 
156 
Laukikanyayakosa 
569. 7805ART: 
The female horses yoked to a chariot, can draw the chariot well, if they make concerted effort. Similarly, suggests the maxim, if the chariot of worldly life is to be drawn safely, the two wheels in the form of the wife and husband should work smoothly and amicably. 
-Po 393 570. In: 
When a lamp is being carried on a high way, the light of the lamp falls on a place, then comes the actual lamp. The light moves forward and that place is darkened slightly. Thus a regular chasing game takes place between the light and the darkness on the highway. The maxim declares that the life is also a game of light and darkness i.e. joy and sorrow, which 
occur alternately in life. 
571. TOYOTE : 
The water in the rainy season flows on the roads and then meets the streams or rivers. So also, asserts the maxim that the small groups of followers in the fields of either politics or philosophy or similar other 
parlances, become one with the bigger groups. 572. fuqunfakir: 
If the sunlight falls on the grass, various colours in it are clearly visible. But if it falls on the Sūryakānta jewel, fire is produced. The maxim on the basis of the above example says that a man may show mercy for 
one but the same man has hatred for another. 573. TELETRA: 
One has to enter the capital city of a king in a disciplined 
Laukikanyayakosa 
157 
manner. One cannot enter the city as he likes. It is better then to be cautious and enter the capital in a queue. This maxim is applicable to the situation where there is harmonious situation and where there is proper 
causal relation. 
574. राजपुत्रव्याधन्यायः 
Once a prince was handed over to a hunter by his stepmother. The hunter brought him up like his own son. Once a relative of the prince came to him and revealed that he was actually a prince only. Thereafter, he began to behave like a prince and cultivated Kș atriya quality in him and after sone days, he became a king. The maxim remarks that the individual soul forgets its real nature and thinks itself to be a limited self only. By and by, with the advice of the preceptor, 
it realizes its own real state of the Brahman. 575. राजसेवान्यायः 
Ex. सेवाधर्मः परमगहनो योगिनामय्यगम्यः। 
- भतृहरि, नीतिशतक, 47 Doing service to anybody is a difficult work. Moreover it is very difficult to serve a king. Inspite of his hard and sincere work, the servant is always blamed. The maxim emphasizes the fact that serving anybody is a 
very difficult work. 576. रात्रिसत्रन्यायः 
Ex. (1) मीमांसासूत्र 4.3.17-19. 
(2) तथा सर्वपापप्रदाहोऽपि ब्रह्मलिङ्गप्रश्नोत्तराभ्यां 
प्राधान्येन प्रतिपिपादयिषित तयोपक्रान्तस्योपासनस्य फलाकाङ्क्षया रात्रिसत्रन्यायेनार्थनादिकफलपरिणामे

Laukikanyâyakośa कर्तव्ये प्रधानार्थवाद इवाङ्गार्थवादे श्रुतस्यापि फलस्य ग्रहणौचित्यात्। 
- Dim4c5414, TETHE 3.3.31. 
According to one of the Mimămsā rules, where no fruit is mentioned pertaining to a particular rite, the fruit mentioned in the laudatory passage should be taken as the fruit of the ritual. But when there is no mention of any fruit, it is laid down that the heaven is 
the fruit, especially in one of the Vedic rituals. 577. TEITA EITTHRITAT: 
Ex. F acit varat pe fruta HSMaTI 
___ राधावेधोपमानेन धर्मप्राप्तिः प्रकीर्तिता। 
-344145143907917, yo 413, 420, 434 The word 'Radhảvedha' in the maxim means aiming at the centre of a target or hitting the bull's eye. It also means the seat for taking the aim. Rädhäbhedin is an adjective used for Arjuna. 
578. TOCUGRITET: 
Even if asafoetida (THD) is removed from a box, the fragrance of it remains behind for sometime. Similarly states the maxim, fragrance or any courtesy leaves its effect behind. So much so that its effect lingers on, 
even if the individual bearing it goes away. 579. Tafaneita: 
The braying of an ass is at the top of its voice, at the beginning but gradually it diminishes and becomes weak. The maxim remarks that the affection and love shown by a wicked person grows on decreasing gradually and finishes at the end. 
Laukikanyāyakośa

580. राहुशिरोन्यायः 
Ex. (i) द्वावेज ग्रसते दिनेश्वरनिशाप्राणेश्वरौ भास्वरौ। 
भ्रातः पर्वजि पश्य दानवपतिः शीर्षाव शेषाकृतिः॥ (ii) जातग्रहत्वेऽपि, असितत्त्वात् सूर्यादिग्रहवन्न द्दश्यते 
गगने पर्वकालादन्यत्र ब्रह्मवाक्यादिति। 
-लौकिकन्याय साहस्री, पृ० 159-163 The head of Rāhu conveys many meanings like serpent and a demon. When Rāhu started drinking nectar, Visnu cut off his head by his Sudarsana discus. Rāhu is also mentioned in astrology many a time. On the 
whole, the word Rāhu stands for inauspicious being. 581. रूमाक्षिप्तकाष्ठन्यायः 
Ex. यथा रूमाया लवणाकरेषु 
मेरौ यथा वोज्ज्वलरुक्मभूमौ। यज्जायते तन्मयमेव तत् स्यात् 
यथा भवेद् वेदविदात्मतुष्टिः॥ -तन्त्रवार्तिक, पृ० 132 बहूनामेकत्र परिणामो दृष्टः। तद्यथा। गवाश्वमहिषमातङ्गाना रूमान्तिक्षिप्तानामेको लवणत्वजातीयलक्षणः परिणामो वर्तितैलानलानां च प्रदीप इति। 
-वाचस्पतिमिश्र, तत्त्ववैशारदी, योगसूत्र टीका 4-14 It is believed that when a piece of wood is thrown in the saline ocean called Rumā, it also becomes saltish. The maxim observing that effect, says that thing is converted into another thing merely remaining in its company. The nature of a thing changes if it comes in 
contact with another thing. 582. रूपसामान्यन्यायः 
When two things have the same form or appearance, it 
160 
Laukikanyayakosa 
does not mean that the two things are completely identical. The rice brought in two houses is rice only but the name, colour, form, smell and in many other 
ways it is not the same-says this maxim. 583. Tamaria: 
Cf. (i) argfa fa dict Stahl, 9o 457. 
(ü) darah muda, qo 363 Once a villager asked a person the meaning of the word Gavaya (a wild bull). The man made a sketch of the animal with the help of some lines. The villager got some idea after seeing the picture. When he went to the forest, he saw a peculiar type of bull, resembling the picture drawn by that man. He could identify it to be a Gavaya. The maxim based on this incident says that a man gets some vague idea about the Ātmā. But with the help of a teacher, he gets a clear, distinct idea 
about the self. 584. ITT: 
When a diseased person dies the disease from which he was suffering, also goes away with him. The maxim states that when an object (Dharmi) perishes, its property (Dharma) also perishes with the object automa 
tically. 585. ERITAT: 
Nobody can sustain without any support. This truth is exemplified in this maxim, taking an example of a creeper, which cannot grow independently. It has to 
take support of a tree. 586. HURYS CRIA: 
Ex. शङिखनी काञ्चनं दद्योदहं शङ्खो लपोरकः वादामि 
बहवाक्यानि न ददामि कपर्दिकाम्॥ 
Laukikanyayakosa 
16 
The maxim maintains that a goddess called “Sankhini may offer gold to the devotee if she is pleased wit him. But conch "Sankha"which simply produces sound (Laporaka) does not give anything. Just by similarity in name, one should not expect even a cowrie from the Sankha (the conch). 
- O 93€ 587. MauitCTRA: 
The maxim speaks about unexpected meeting of person: which is like the coming together of an Amalakī frui from the forest and salt from the sea. Though the original taste of these two is different, the combined 
taste is very sweet. 588. 1979UFRUTA: 
Garlic has a strong, lingering smell, so it is considered unholy and prohibited in the Sástras. It has medicinal value also. One patient with an intention of curing his disease, ate it. But to his bad fate, his disease was not cured. He committed a sin by eating that prohibited thing. So he suffered from double disadvantage by eating garlic. The maxim aims at describing an act of 
double disadvantage by giving the example of garlic. 589. Ara Araf Hochufai RM14.. 
Ex. ufisa Hint fent armani 
फलं तत्रैव बध्नाति कार्पासे रकाता यथ। 
-4749f2H5E, 347&cresta; HO 700 If cotton seeds are sprinkled over with the lac dye and then sown in the ground, the cotton yield which grows in the field in due course of time is also red cotton. Taking this example of the red cotton yield, the maxim says implicitly that the actions in this birth are tinged with the subliminal impressions. 
162 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
590 mismuita para: 
Ex. TETRICENalferrata zitsto TEGA: 
भवेदुपनिषन्नाम्ना लाङ्गलं जीवनं यथा। 
-सुरेश्वराचार्य, सम्बन्धवार्तिक, पृ० 9 A plough is the invariable, inseparable means of livelihood for a farmer. The maxim, indicating this sense of inseparability becomes applicable when the 
means-end, cause-effect are said to be inseparable. 591. MIS MATURITA: 
The maxim speaks about the dangerous futile efforts. That effort is like trying to cross the river by catching 
the tail of a dog. 592. greita: 
This maxim implies two senses (1) Just as a spider weaves a net from the threads, 
taken from its own body, the God also creates the phenomena of the world from his body only. As the spider is the instrumental and material cause of the threaded web, God is also the instrumental and material cause of the world. 
- TO 502 593. T RITA: 
A stone and a clod of earth look alike but there is a lot of difference in their weight. The maxim states that the two things which apparently look alike, are quite 
different in their shape, weight and quality. --1770 675 594. mienskir4: 
The maxim gives the example of a stick and a clod of 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
163 
earth. The stick completely destroys the clod of earth and converts the clod into the powder like substance. This implies that the stick and the ciod of earth have a destroyer and the destroyed relation between these two. Whenever, this relation of a destroyer-destroyed is to 
be described, this maxim is applied. 10 503 595. ME 04 ISTRITA: 
The maxim compares the good and noble men with strong, sturdy iron. Iron does not stick to any other metal quickly nor does it grasp anything suddenly. Similarly, the good men also are very sturdy and so 
they do not bend quickly like iron. 596. Geralchautat: 
The maxim mentions an important charateristic of a magnet. Without moving from its place, without doing anything, sitting in one place only, the magnet converts an iron piece into a magnet by attracting the iron piece towards itself. This principle is applicable to the Sāṁkhya doctrine that Purusa attracts Prakrti towards himself and makes her active. The activity of iron is 
attributed to magnet only. 597. MatitaRITET: 
Iron acts like a fireball when it comes in contact with fire. The maxim infers that good or bad characteristics of a person arise only in a particular good or bad 
company of the people or friends. 598, compra: 
Vajra is the weapon of Indra or it also means a diamond. When two things are brought together, they stick to each other so firmly that it becomes difficult to separate them. This inseparable relation or condition between 
164 
Laukikanyāyakośa 
the two things is termed as Vajralepa. The weapon of Indra and the diamond also are unbreakable. Similarly the relation which cannot be broken or which cannot 
be erased or separated is described by this maxim. 599. वटबीजन्यायः 
Ex. तं होवाच यं वै सोम्यैत्तमणिमानं न निभालयस एतस्य वै सौम्येषोऽणिम्न एव महान् न्यग्रोधस्तिष्ठति श्रद्धत्स्वं सोम्येति। स य एषोणिमैतदात्म्यामिदं सर्वं तत् सत्यं स आत्मा तत्त्वमसि श्वेतकेतो इति। 
-छान्दोग्योपनिषद् 6.12.2.3 The maxim refers to the fact that from a small, tiny banyan seed, a big gigantic banyan tree evolves. Similarly 
from the most subtle Brahman, a big universe evolves. 600. वटेयक्षन्यायः 
Cf. गतानुगतिको लोको न लोकः पारमार्थिकः। -सा० 25 There is a common blind belief that the Yakṣa or a particular power resides in a banyan tree. The people believe in it uncritically and so no one goes near that banyan tree without finding the reality about it. The maxim refers to such uncritical, undescerning 
belief. 601. वत्सक्षीरन्यायः 
Ex. वत्सविवृद्धिनिमित्तं क्षीरस्य यथा प्रवृत्तिरज्ञस्य। पुरुषविमोक्षनिमित्तं तथा प्रकृतिः प्रधान 
-साङ्खयकारिका 58 An inert Praksti can bring about the liberation of Puruşa. The maxim proves this by giving the example of milk which though insentient, brings about the nourishment in a calf.

Example-- न चानवस्था अवश्यवेद्यत्वानभ्युपगमानिश्चयवदन्यथा तु अनिश्चितनिश्चयस्य नाद्यनिश्चयोऽपि सिध्येत न चास्तवात्मन्यनिश्चय इति तादिदं वधूमाषमापन वृतानामनुहरति। 
-आत्मविवेक, पृ० 87 This maxim tells that even good intentional actions also lead to undesirable situations. A Brāhmaṇa used to give a handful of blackgram to his wife to offer them to the beggars. When his son got married, he entrusted this work of distribution of alms to his daughter-in-law, thinking that less blackgrams will be carried in her little fists. This girl was very beautiful and good looking. So many beggars started coming to his house, not for blackgram but to have a look at this sweet lady, resulting in the distribution of a large 
quantity of blackgrams. 604. वध्यधातुकन्यायः 
Example 
प्रतिपद्य पदार्थं हि विरोधात् तद्विरोधिनः। पश्चादभावं जानाति वध्यधातुकवत् पदात्॥ 
-तैत्तिरीयवार्तिक, 2.1.65; सा० 380 The killer and the one going to be killed can never remain together. To indicate that hostile persons cannot stay together this maxim is employed.

-महाभारत, उद्योगपर्व 37-42; सा० 391 This maxim shows the mutually helping attitude of the tiger and the forest. The tiger protects the forest from 
encroachment and the forest gives shelter to the tiger. 606. वन्ध्यापुत्रन्यायः 
This maxim can be applied to some improbable 
concepts like the son of a barren woman. 607. वनीकीटन्यायः 
Ex. स्वच्छकन्दुकवनीकन्यायेनानिशमत्र ते। 
भ्रमन्तो नाप्नुवन्त्यमन्यत्वं संविदन्ति च॥ व्योमस्य कन्दुकभ्रान्तपिपीलिकवटाकुलम्। 
अद्यापि संस्थिता राजन्न च खेदं भजन्ति ते॥ 
-योगवासिष्ठ, निर्वाणप्रकरण (उत्तरार्ध) 131, 15-16 The maxim refers to a ball, revolving round and round. If some ants or small insects happen to climb on the ball, they also go on revolving. When revolving round and round continuously is to be described, this maxim 
is used. 608. वरगोष्ठीन्या: 
The relatives of the bridegroom and the relatives of the 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
167 
bride come together and decide about the marriage of the bride and the bridegroom. If the relatives of both of them give their consent, then only the marriage takes place, says the inaxim. 'Gosthi' is a place where talks on certain topics are delivered. Secondarily, it means any place where discussions take place. This maxim refers to a place of discussion where some discussion about the selection of a bridegroom takes place. It may also mean a place where some decisions 
are taken after discussion of both the parties. 609, Tech Chea Urare: 
The maxim literally means that the selection of a bride which may result in the peril of the bridegroom, should be avoided. By extended application it exhorts people not to undertake even desirable things if they are 
detrimental to the existence of some good things. 610. gatart: 
Cf. HHİFRE 3.8; 25-27 The maxim refers to a Mimāṁsā rule that when lustre is solicited from the God of fire, the lustre is accrued by the sacrificer and not by the priest who actually 
articulates the request. 611. वलीमुखनारिकेलन्यायः 
The monkey knows how to pluck the coconut fruit and make it fall down. It does not know how to use that fruit. The maxim describes an ignorant man who cannot 
make use of the available things. 612. afaqura: 
The maxim refers to the association of fire with the smoke. In inferences, the probans (Vyāpti) like--where 
168 
Laukikarya yakosa 
there is smoke there is fire-plays an important role. 
The maxim refers to this probans only. 613. afarita: 
This maxim gives two special features of the fire: (i) Fire, though alone, can burn houses. (ii) Many fire-particles (fire-sparks) emanate from 
the fire. 614. afalaus : 
The maxim suggests that from one Brahman only, many worldly things are produced, as many sparks are emitted 
from one fire only. 615. arcfTGRIE: 
The maxim refers to a general rule of grammar that one sentence should convery one meaning only. But if the expressive ideas are more than one, then those fragments of that sentence are mutually dependent. According to Mimāṁsā also, extracting many connota tions from a sentence leads to a fault of 'split sentence' Mimämsä rules that if there is some injunction in one part, other parts of that sentence should be understood to be a laudatory passage to avoid Vākyabheda. If it is laid down that the inquiry into Dharma should be undertaken after the study of the Vedas, it does not mean that inquiry into Dharma is prohibited before Vedic studies; othewise the interpretation will lead to Vākyabhedha. वाजिमन्दुरान्याय: Mandurā means a stable, the place where horses are kept. The word Väjin means a horse. The word Vāji in this compound is redundant. There are many maxims 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
169 
where the word understood is repeated with or without 
any purpose. 617. augurat: 
The wind extinguishes a lamp. This act takes place in two ways. (i) The thing perishes due to hostile causes. 
Due to some reasons, the constituent parts of that thing get exhausted, The maxim is applicable 
to those cases. 618. arghaurrera: 
*Eating of air' can also be taken as an activity connected 
with eating. The maxim prohibits other types of eating. 619. arestreito TriTT: 
Cf. titou 14:, F oUURITA: Air becomes hot or cold owing to the presence or absence of heat or due to the contact or detachment with heat. They are, however not natural characteristics. The maxim is applicable to a case where an external 
or uncommon characteristic is superimposed externally. 620, afmutaria: 
The maxim is based on a common belief that Rama killed Vāli who was the brother of Sugrīva. Never theless, Sugrīva is supposed to be stronger than Vāli. 
621, arcatan: 
This maximi is applied to a deluding phantasm like the one observed by a traveller in the desert. He sees fiowing water from a distance but actually there is nothing but hot sand only

622. विक्रीतगवीन्यायः 
Ex. विक्रीय पण्यं मूल्येन क्रेतुः यन्न प्रदीयते। 
विक्रीयासम्प्रदानं तद्विवादपदमुच्यते॥ The maxim echoes a situation where the owner of a thing retains its ownership, even after selling it away, as the owner of a cow wants to retain its ownership with him even after selling it, with some ulterior 
intention. 623. विक्रीते करिणि किमङ्कशो विवाद न्यायः 
Ex. i) सौमित्रिर्वदति विभीषणाय लङ्कां देहि त्वं

विक्रीते करिणि किमङ्कुशे विवादः॥ -सा० 750 The maxim decries the act of quarrelling for the price of a goud when the elephant is sold away. Quarrelling for petty things is futile and also foolish when the big 
thing is disposed off. 624. विनिगमनाविरहन्यायः 
'Vinigamana' means considering only one aspect of some matters when other aspects are also possible. In astronomy some scholars concentrate on ‘Drgganitā method for the Süryasiddhānta. But it cannot be proper to ascertian that Süryasiddhãnt doctrine is the only right one.

___-हितोपदेश, मित्रलाभ, 74 This maxim describes a double tongued hypocrite who speaks sweet words but entertains poisonous attitude towards some person. He is, as the maxim says, like a jar full of poison but the mouth of the jar is filled with 
milk. Superficial innocence indeed! 626. विषकृमिन्यायः 
Ex. विप्रास्मिन्नगरे महान् कथय कस्तालगुमाणां गणः

-वृद्धचाणक्य Certain type of environnent or atmosphere is harmful or unsuitable for many people but one who is born and brought up in that unhealthy atmosphere, can put up with that environment owing to his breeding and development in it, like the insect which is born in poison only, can endure poison, owing to its long stay 
or contact in poison. 627. विषवृक्षन्यायः

Laukikarłyciyakosa 
If some work, though despicable, is accomplished with one's own endeavour, it is not proper to set it aside. It is not proper, declares the maxim, to uproot i tree, 
nurtured by oneself, even though it is poisonous. 628. f6 SHRITT: 
A bird can easily obtain a fruit which is high on the tree, unlike an ant or a monkey which cannot reach the sweet fruits which are on the top of the trec. Similarly, a person of the best qualification who has acquired right knowledge and has pure heart, can attain perfect knowledge as compared to other persons. 
-HO 517 629. atfernegara: 
Ex. atalaçaria agrafirang Gilfarani 'Vici' means a billow. When many billows come together, they develop into a Taranga (a wave). Due to wind, a billow develops into the shape of a wave. The maxim emphasizes the slowly developing billow into a wave. This is how the sound waves also develop and spread. 
--HO 228 
630. Toha YURT: 
This maxim hints at doing a difficult thing by a simple device. If a wolf is to be caught, some butter is kept on the head of the wolf. As it melts, it enters the eyes of the wolf and thus it becomes easy to catch the wolf. 
- Ho 251 631. q&ftri: 
The birds live on the trees. They build their nests on the tree and nourish their eggs on the trees only. Simply 
Laukikunycīyakosa 
173 
because they grow and fly on high trees, they cannot be superior to those which live on the lower earth. The eminence is judged by quality and not by the height of their birth places. 
-HO 52 
632. 9:40 HITRITAT: 
The maxim tells as to how one can please all the people by one action only and gives the example of a man who had climbed on the tree. The people who were standing below, requested him to shake a particular branch of their choice. But the clever man shook the whole tree. By this simple act, he could shake almost 
all the branches and please every one. TO 52 633. ffur: 
यथा तरोर्मूलनिषिञ्चनेन तृप्यन्ति तत्स्कन्धभुजोऽपि शाखाः। प्राणोपहाराच्च यथेन्द्रियाणां तथैव सर्वाहणमच्युतेज्याः॥ The maxim tells that by satisfying the vital breath, all the senses can be gratified as by pouring water at the root of a tree, it is (indirectly) supplied to all the branches of the tree. Similarly everyone will give respect if only. Hari is worshipped. (or if only one God Hari is 
worshipped, all the Gods will be satisfied). 634. Quacharia RITA: 
Once Indra was pleased with an old virgin lady and gave her a boon. She asked from one boon many things very cleverly. She solicited that her sons should eat rice mixed with abundent ghee and milk in a plate made of Kāmsya metal. This clever lady asked for a husband, sons, cows, abundent grain and costly vessels etc. from one boon only. 
-HO 2 635. Gagnhuseta: 
The maxim asserts that if a young lady is married to 
174 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
an old man, she would definitely pretent to be loyal to her husband. 
636. EJUTORRITU 
Once a blind, old, unmarried and poverty stricken man practised penance. The God was pleased by his sever penance and told him to ask for a boo:1. He uttered a small sentence but accomplished many things by that boon. His clever request was to see his grandson sitting on the throne. God was pleased by his clever request and granted wealth, health, progeny, wife and cyes also. 
-- Ilo 3 637, gogaar: 
When a courtesan becomes old, she pretends to be penelope. The maxim based on this fact, implies that a person thinks himself to be pious, simple and non violent when he becomes old and weak. This attitude 
is developed owing to helplessness and not by virtue. 638. feta ETRIT: 
A thief was bitten by a scorpion. He began to cry loudly. He could not run away because of the pain. Hearing his loud cries, the people of the house gathered there. They saw the stolen articles and caught him red handed. The people also bet him severely. He could not do anything because of the unbearable pain. --The 
maxim speaks about this thief. 639. africaTTATI: 
If a scorpion bites a monkey, its hectic movements go on increasing. It becomes more confused and begins to run here and there, out of pain. Monkey is a very unsteady animal. Because of the scorpion bite, it runs 
Laukikanyāyakośa 
175 
more excitedly out of pain. The maxim conveys that a fickle man becomes more and more confused, if he 
suffers from some pain. 640. afserface RTA: 
A jester or a joker is always given a role of dancing and gambling. When he dances and makes fun, people and children laugh loudly to their hearts content. His sunny ways and his artificial behaviour are a part of his acting. But if a scorpion bites him and out of sever pain, he begins to dance, people take it as fun only 
and no one will take it very seriously. 641. QUOTCFTTTY: 
The two rivers, Ganga and Yamunā flow separately but when they come together at Prayāga they become one and only one stream flows. Whether separate or united they get the same reflection of the sky. The maxim intends to show that there is no difference between Brahmä, Vişnu and Siva. 
- Ho 127 642. ROTHRITT: 
When the rivers are in floods, many objects on the bank are washed away. But the reed grass (or cane) on the bank of the rivers, just bends down and then again raises its head when the floods are over. The maxim implies that the self-respected persons may bend. That means they may carry a low profile in the advetsity but they regain their normal form when the bad days or 
the calamity is over. 643. aaichteret: 
The maxim alludes to the unsteady love of a courtesan. As she entertains many lovers, she cannot be loyal to any one of them. 
176 
Laukikanyayakości 
644. वेश्यापुत्रजनकन्यायः 
This maxim is used to describe a queer relation like that of a courtesan and her son, as she maintains relations with many people, it is difficult to ascertain 
the father of her son. 645. व्यपगतलेपालाबून्यायः 
The maxim is based on a peculiar nature of a pumpkin. When the earth is applied to it, it goes down and sinks. When that applied clay is washed off, it starts floating on the water. The maxim implies the Jain doctrine that when a person is freed from action, he moves up and up. In this example the pumpkin is like an individual 
and the cover of earth is his Karman. -सा० 704 646. व्यपदेशिन्यायः 
If a man has got only one son, he is the eldest and is also the youngest. When two characteristics are applicable to one only this maxim becomes applicable. By Vyapadeśa two qualities are superimposed on one object). 
सा० 32 647. व्यभिचारिणीन्यायः 
यथा व्यसनिनी नारी व्यग्रापि गृहकर्मणि। तदेवास्वादयत्यन्तः परसङ्गरसायनम्॥ एवं तत्त्वे पदे शुद्धे धीरो विश्रान्तिमागतः। तदेवास्वादयन्तर्बहिर्व्यवहरन्नपि॥ 
-लौकिकन्याय साहस्री; सा० 45 An unchaste lady always remembers the pleasant moments of contact which she had with the paramour, even though she is apparently busy in daily routine work. The maxim states the similar kind of joy of 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
177 
remembering is also felt by an aspirant who thinks of 
the exquisite joy of meditation over the Brahman. 648. TETETTERI: 
Some cunning fellows bend low before the people. But it shows their hypocritic nature. It is not their behaviour to bend before anybody. It is just the beginning of their nefarious activities. The maxim gives the example of a tiger, a thief and a bow whose bending augurs dangerous results. 
- HIO 809 649. auraitaitelt: 
The maxim says that the milk of the tigress (or a lioness) becomes more effective when it is stored in a golden vessel. Similarly, advice imparted to the students who are endowed with good qualities like physical and mental control, becomes very effective and powerful 
when it is given by the teacher. 650. martRTA: 
The maxim speaks of eternal enmity like the one 
between the snake and the mungoose. 651. aretiratura: 
Vrātya is one who has not undergone any Sarñskara like Upanayana. Such a Brāhmaṇa is not qualified to 
solemnize Samskäras in others. 652. afectoT: 
When the seeds are sown, only the upper cover is the beginining; gradually the inner milklike substance gets solidified and the grain is formed. That darkness (Tamas is manifested in Siva; slowly comes activity (Rajas) and serenity (sattva)' the three Guņas also personify Brahmā, Visnu and Siva.

catches the birds in a net. 654. शकुनिसूत्रन्यायः 
Ex. यथा पक्षी च सूत्रं च नानावृक्षरसा यथा। 
यथा नद्यः पमुद्राश्च शुद्धोदलवणे यथा॥ चोरापहार्यों च यथा पुंविषयावपि। तथा जीवेश्वरौ भिन्नौ सर्वदैव विलक्षणौ॥ 
-लौकिकन्याय साहस्री; साc 817 The maxim refers indirectly to the view of the dualists who believe that the individual self and the God are different though they are related to each other; as a bird and a chord are different, though the bird is tied 
with a string. 655. शङ्कत्खातदंष्ट्रोरगन्यायः 
The maxim remarks that a serpent whose fangs are removed becomes harmless. Even if it bites there is no venum in it. So it becomes non-poisonous and thus harmless. Similarly an enemy whose helpers are perished or are destroyed, cannot do anything. He becomes harmless. 
-सा० 288 656. शङ्खवेलान्यायः

-श्लोकवार्तिक, 137. The maxim speaks about a particular delusion. That event takes place simultaneously sometime when a sharp needle is pierced through the hundred petals of a lotus flower. Their softness creates a delusion that all the hundred petals are pierced simutaneously, the needle has to loose the contact with the earlier one and then contact the next one. But this takes place so quickly, that a delusion is created that the needle has pierced 
the petals at the same time. 658, शते पञ्चाशदितिन्यायः 
It is needless to say that the number fifty is included in the number hundred. The higher one includes the lower one of the same type. Sacrifice, charity are included in one comprehensive term merit. 
-सा० 489 659. शब्दसुखाश्रितकुरङ्गगतिन्यायः 
The maxim tells that a deer which is very much enticed by music can be easily caught by playing music near it. This means that one can be easily deceived by one's 
habit only. 660. शरपुरुषीयन्यायः 
Cf. अजाकृपाणीयन्यायः, खल्वाटविल्वीयन्यायः. Once a perosn was taking an aim to shoot an arrow at a particular target. The arrow hit a person who was 
180 
Laukikunyüyakosa 
passing in the range of the arrow and was killed. The maxim is applicable to such sudden, unexpected 
accidents. 661. prata orterit: 
Cf. grupp: The maxim refers to an incident. It shows how a person who comes within the range, is affected by the action. A person was sprinkling sugar at one place. At that time a person just went across. As the action was continuous, the person who passed by was also 
sprinkled over and became smeared with sugar. 662. TOTA: 
A type of moth jumps on a lamp or on the flame of the lamp and is thus reduced to ashes instantly. The maximi is applicable to a person of the nature of a moth who brings about his own destruction thoughtlessly by raslı 
action. 663. graharrepita: 
This maxim is generally used to convey the idea that a king should collect taxes from his subject very carefully. He should exploit the people very delicately like a mouse which takes out the lower portion of a man 
very slowly and cleverly. 664. gaiataria: 
There is no use of applying fragrant unguents to a corpse. Even if we apply, what is the use of it? The 
maxim decries useless actions like this. 665. Preifaturi: 
Cf, PET FRA: The maxim is used to point out impossible and 
Laukikanyayakosa

improbable things like the horns of a hare. The rabbit does not have horns. It is only figinent of imagination 
that we think of this kind of impossible things. 666. शाखाचङ्क्रमणन्यायः 
Juinping from one branch to the other branch of a tree like the rnonkeys. The maxim is applicable to those persons who jump from one topic to another, without 
trcating one topic thoroughly. 667. शाखाचन्द्रन्यायः 
Ex. तरुशाखाग्रदृष्ट्यैव सोमं यद्वत् प्रदर्शयेत्।

-तैत्तिरीय भाष्य वार्तिक 2.1.232; सा० 249 The maxim applies to the action of a man. He wants to show the moon of the second day of the bright half of the month. But he points out to some other constellation, seen through the branches of a tree. The moon is hidden behind the branches. Slowly he tries to divert the 
attention to the moon. 668. शिखाकर्पूरन्यायः 
When camphor is burnt over the flame of a lamp, the lamp may continue to burn for sometime but it extinguishes soon and even the camphor extinguishes with it. This example is adopted by this maxim which is used when the thing and its substratum both perish 
at the same time. 669. शिरोवेष्टनेन नासिकास्पर्शन्यायः 
Cf. द्राविड प्राणायामन्यायः शिरोवेष्टनेनाङ्गल्या नासिका प्रवेशवत्।

182 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
man is asked to show the tip of his nose, he will take his hand round his neck and then shows his nose. This shows the unnecessary cumbersome way of doing things. When a work can be done in the most easy method but unnecessarily uneasy or difficult method is 
adopted, this maxim is applicable. 670. FUTMITTIRIRI: 
The letters inscribed on a stone do not get blurred. They remain on the stone for a long time. Rather they remain there permanently. The maxim is applicable to 
such imperishable thing. 671. gitaratura racha PRITAT: 
To try to grab the rays of the moon by the hand is nothing but an impossible work. This maxim is applied to a situation where some work is being done which is beyond one's capacity. 
-TIC 889 672. Fie ra: 
A stone can be put to many uses. Even a sacred idol can be fashioned out of a stone. So it is clear that worthiness or worthlessness of an object, depends mostly on the sentimental attachment we have for it than on the substance. In such situations this maxim is applicable.

Some soldiers, sense the danger of attack and take shelter below the chariots on the back of the elephants, though there is no danger of attack. They are ‘Sukamohanas'. A female mungoose sitting on the branch of a tree becomes afraid on seeing some birds on the tree. This 
kind of unnecessary fear is called 'Sukanalikānyāya'. 675, gusturir: 
To try to remove a needle, fallen on a street with the help of the trunk of an elephant. This means using heavy means or instruments for a triflling purpose. 
The maxim indicates this type of human behaviour. 676. Peta MOUR: 
Cf. Fickfreira: This maxim aims at pointing out the difference between individual self and the God which is the same as one between the fresh water and the saline water. 
- HTO 819 677. Icchinetonketara: 
The maxim states that the people do not approach a poor penniless person as the fish do not try to resort to 
a dried lake. 678. LuchareITAT: 
A simple, ordinary lady observes a beautiful lady having 
184 
Laukikanyayakosa 
beautiful form and structure. She has beautiful protruding breasts too. This simple lady feels jealous of her beautiful form says that the well developed breasts actually deforms the body, instead of adoring it. Even the bodice put on them, pricks the breasts. The maxim based on this fact 'suggests that a person lacking a particular thing jealously condemns the other who possesses it and tries to conceal his want of it by some 
ridiculous argument. 679. Lucferir: 
Cf. CRI: The maxim means performing a sacrifice in a dry manner. A disciple may not have correct idea about the procedure or the paraphernalia of a sacrifice. He tries to make prowiso for the articles or uses the articles which are imagined to be those, necessary for it. Neverthess, he slowly acquires the knowledge of the 
sacrificial procedure. 680. [cht alfechter: 
A pig tries to find out a dirty place for movements, even though it enters a beautiful garden which is enriched by lovely, colourful fully-bloomed flowers, The maxim extends this type of behaviour to the wicked persons who target the weak points of the good persons and ignores their good qualities. 
-HO 518 
681. Para: 
A winnowing basket throws out unnecessary matter like husk and pieces of stone and retains pure unmixed grain with it. Based on this fact, the maxim describes a

Howsoever fragrant and beautiful they may be, the flowers growing in a burial ground, go in vain, as

there is nobody to enjoy or appreciate the beauty and fragrance of those flowers. Similarly, the maxim conveys that a person born in an unhealthy or nasty environment, does not shine, inspite of his merits as 
there is nobody to appreciate them. 685. 349/acperire:

-f601457, FH13774 68; HIO 764 The people who come to the cemetary for cremating the dead body, always enshrine the thought that the human life is momentary and all things are destined to come to an end. They brood over the transitoriness of human life. But the moment they come back, the idea of non-attachment vanish away and all of them get engrossed in the temporary worldly affairs. The maxini insists that a momentary rise of detachment which is a 
reaction to a certain situation, is never effective. 
686, Urol: 
The maxim aims at describing the change of situation in human life; observing that whenever the black colour of a jar or a piece of cloth disappears, red colour can be easily applied to them. The situational change is quite natural. 
-HTO 506 687. Permethanat: 
A person gave the name of his brother-in-law (wife's brother) to his dog, to make his wife angry. He used

to abuse the dog uttering his brother-in-law's name. His wife used to become sorrowful, thinking that her husband was abusing her brother only. Really, God is one but a sense of differentiation is deliberately created by giving various names to the same God. Vişnu or Siva are eulogized with some ulterior motive only. 
-HTO 136 688. PICUAT: 
Once a pigeon was just coming out of its nest when a falcon attacked it and killed it. The maxim is employed to describe such unexpected, accidental, dangerous

Cf. Canferatur:, Orgfaefferatur: Some Vedic injunctions prescribe the deity worship (upăsana). This can be effected even by the superim posed godhood and the injunction of worship can be valid. But this is not correct. Inspite of the worship oriented injunction, the suggested meaning can be valid, in accordance with the Devatādhikarananyāya. The Syenādhikarnanyāya also conveys the same idea.

So long as a crocodile is in the water, it can pull even the elephants into the water. But if it comes out of the water even a dog can assail it. This maxim suggests that if a man is firm in his position, nothing will happen to him. But once he is displaced, even an ordinary 
fellow will start harassing. 694. pantafeRIFT: 
The maxim declares that the natural enmity between any two persons remain unabated like the one between 
a dog and a cat. 695. garigitter: 
Even if the owner beats a dog severly, the dog does not desert him. So also, declares the maxim that it is 
the nature of a poor, helpless, dependent person. 696. POTERITAT: 
The Mimārsā says that in any injunctory passage, the 
· verbal part of the injunction expresses Arthi Bhāvanā.

It has three aspects--What is be expected-by which and how? The objective expected is the heaven, according to this Şaşthädyanyāya which is almost the

There are two injunctions--one takes the Sodasin cup at the time of Atirātra sacrifice; and also one does not take that Sodasin cut at the time of Atirātra sacrifice. As the two cannot be reconciled, option (Vikaipa) is permitted here. When one sense is accepted, the other 
one becomes exception (Paryudāsa). 698. संवादिभ्रमन्यायः 
on seeing the lustre of a jewel, somebody develops a delision that it is a jewel only. But actually, he grasps a jewel which catching it. Similarly in “Tattramasi" --- तत्त्वमसि-त्वम् is like a lustre of the jewel but while grasping he grasps तत्. तत् is Brahman only. This is an 
example of concurrent delusion. 699. सक्तुन्यायः 
The maxim describes that peevish person who gives up food and subsists on Sattu that is a kind of low type 
of grain only. 700. सङ्गगुणदोषन्यायः

- भर्तृहरि, नीतिशतक, 58 The maxim asserts that it is the company which gives rise to virtues or vices in a person. It is rightly said 
190 
Laukikanyayakosa 
that a man is known by the company he keeps. The rain water drop fallen on hot iron vanishes immediately, it shines like pearls on lotus leaf but it is actually converted into a pearl if fallen in the sea-shell at the 
time of Svāti nakṣatra. 701, HEOGETTORITA: 
If a jar is porous, all the water poured in it, will flow out from the tiny holes On the basis of this fact the maxim suggests that a man of extra vagant habits looses everything he earns. Even though he earns a lot, his pockets will rernain empty because of his spendthrift nature. 
702. AYRIRO: 
See-मीमांसान्यायप्रकाश with the commentary प्रभा, पृ० 147, 148. Sandansa means a forcep. When two organic things are caught, the third one in between them is also caught. This type of grasping is explained by Sandansa 
nyāya in Mimānsā. 703. # HUTORITAT: 
According to this maxim, a recluse who has renounced everything in this world and leads a solitary life, cannot have any contact with a woman. It is quite impossible for him to keep any relation with a woman. If he has, 
then it is a rare wonder! 704. High CRTA: 
The maxim suggests that a little good does not change the nature of the bad, as litte drops of honey does not change the sali le test of the sea-water.

When there was churning of ocean the gods and the demons participated. As a result, nectar came out of the ocean-churning which was taken away by the gods. But the ocean was put to extreme hardship. This maxim is used, describing a situation in which one is put to 
troubles and the other reaps the fruit of it. 706. HESTER: 
Cf. जलताडनन्यायः, आन्धदर्पणन्यायः, पिष्टपेषणन्यायः The rain showers do not show any change when they fall in the ocean. Actually the rain should fall on the dry land. The maxim brings out the uselessness of the unnecessary acts. 
707. FIETTOTU: 
This maxim refers to a rule that if it is not possible to relate every word to the sentence severally, one should try to contrue the meaning of all the words. This maxim is more related or rather more connected with the formation of a sentence or to the science of formation 
of the sentence. 708. HauriTAT: 
A cobra does not remain without raising its hood, even though it is in a very difficult situation. It tries to frighten the people around. Similarly, a man tries to show his resistance even in a very difficult condition. He tries his level best to show his existence even in that 
troublesome situation. 709. HafargefMRITT:

The maxim describes the nature of a wise man who try to save as much as possible when there is a danger 
of total destruction. 710. HafüRITA: 
The maxim refers to a common practice that all the invitees should come in time to take food. If a person comes late, he will not be served food in that batch. He should wait for the other batch to commence. Joining the lunch in the middle is considered to be out of 
manners. 711. Afeto Torira:-Affari 
यथा सलिलमाविश्य बहुधा भाति भास्करः।

The sun seems to be multifarious when its reflection is seen in the water. Similarly, one God remains in innumerable bodies, creating an impression that he 
has innumerable bodies. This is a delusion. 712. Higifchfach higifachchefqurrit: 
Niska is a golden coin which weighs 108 grms Kārs äpana is a silver coin of the size of a rupee. But if the availibility of a Niska is doubtful and that of a Kārş āpaņa is assured, it should be preferred. The maxim exorts to accept less valuable thing if it is available easily than to wait for the doubtful thing.

A sentence becomes expectant when there is a possibility of some other matter. The non-expectant injunction undermines the expectant injuction. This can be proved by the two Vedic sentences.

715. FHFETUETTA: 
This maxim is used to describe a difficult and an impossible task, like that of tying u bell in the neck of a 
lion. 716. fria RITI: 
This maxim is used to describe a permanent, natural enmity between two persons, two religions, two castes, 
as it exists between a lion and a deer. 717. FEATRITET: 
Once'a shepherd found a small cub of lion. He kept it in the herd of sheep. It began to behave like a sheep only, forgetting its real nature. The maxim based on this incident, suggests that owing to prolonged contact, 
a man thinks that his body is his soul only. 718. HET&RITAT: 
The milk of a lioness when kept in a golden vessel, shows good effect and proper result. Similarly, the sermons preached by a good preceptor if bestowed on a well controlled, fully enriched disciple will result in good fruit.

A man got a son by propitiating a deity through his devotion. He wanted another son, so he started propitiating another deity. He got another son but the earlier son was put to death by the anger of the previous deity. The maxim conveys the lesson that even God does not help a greedy person.

-साङ्ख्यातत्त्वकौमुदी, पृ० 13 The maxim refers to an ancient tale of Sunda and Upasunda, the two demons. They were brothers but started quarrelling with each other for obtaining a nymph called Tilottama. In the strife, both of them died. This hints at the fate of persons, fighting for a 
worthless cause and ending their lives for nothing. 724. सुपेटिकास्थापनन्यायः 
The maxim informs that the devotees keep their (devoted) minds which are like jewels, safely by surrendering 
them to gods, as valuables are kept in a box for safety. 725. सुप्तडिम्भमुखचुम्बनन्यायः 
The maxim brings forth the futility of certain actions, like that of kissing a child when it is asleep. This 
action is fruitless. 726. सुप्तप्रबुद्धन्यायः 
In Bhāgavata 1.3, a peculiar point is raised as a prima facie view and then it is refuted. Is there any possility for acquiring the knowledge of the Vedas sponta neously? The final doctrine says that the God only having the knowledge of Self-validity can create the world. But sometimes, however, it is seen that the Vedic knowledge acquired by some one, with the instructions from the preceptors, can repeat it even after getting up from sleep. This change, according to the maxim is 
196 
Laukikanyāyakośa 
likely to form the condition of that of the sleep to 
awakening. 727. Cart: 
The two words Subhagā and Bhikṣu cannot be just a posed normally, as they indicate opposite qualities. Once this two approached a third person and asked for refuge in his house. He, out of compassion, gave shelter to Subhagã. The maxim contends that two opposite persons or objects cannot stay together.

- Tail 1.10 The maxim compares gold with a scholar in as much as both of them have to undergo rigorous tests and 
troubles before establishing their excellence. 729. urarchief: 
This maxim gives out a common truth that a person does simple acts first and takes up difficult tasks afterwards. Once a person went to a blacksmith and asked him to prepare a frying pan. Another man approached him and asked him to make a needle for him. Obviously, he undertook the easy work of making a needle`at the beginning.

They wanted to warın up their bodies. All of a sudden, they came across some Gunja fruits. Thinking them to be fire particles, they collected them and began to blow air to brighten thern into fire. A sparrow which was observing this fruitless effort, tried to convince the monkeys stating that they were Gunja fruits and not the fire sparks. At this the monkeys were enraged and killed the sparrow in the fury. Citing this example, the inaxim conveys that giving advice to the foolish is 
dangerous and ultimately ends in death. 731. El proftata: 
Ex. स यथा शकुनिः सूत्रेण प्रबद्धो दिशं दिशं पतित्वा

-501-trailefree 6.8.2 When a bird is tied to a string, it tries to make movements; but it can go till the range of the string only. It comes to the same point again and again. Through this example, the maxim suggests that the mind may try to move afar owing to its fickleness, but 
it comes back ultimately to Prana only. 732. Estic corect: 
Once a man approached a weaver. He handed over some yarn to him and requested him to weave a cloth for him. “How can he ask for a cloth”, thought the weaver. Only after the weaving operation, cloth can be produced and not before that. This is a case of future event which (futuristic action) is inentioned by the 
maxim. 733. Fufrir: 
When it is said that the sun has set, the idea implied in 
198 
Laukikanyāyakosa 
it is that the time for the activities of the thieves, paramour and the like has arrived, Similarly when the king of a particular country dies, the time for the enemy to attack that country has come, This idea is indirectly conveyed 
by the maxim 734. #earga R77: 
The matter perceived by the senses dissolves in the senses, as salt put in water gets dissolved in it. On the same lines, all the adjuncts which are false get dissolved; as the serpent notion is dissolved in the rope. The 
maxim supports the Advaita doctrine. 735. HIERTE UTRITI: 
The maxim underlines the steady, gradual process of an aspirant who is in search of self. As he steps up he gives up the previous step which is then, identified as the Self. He thus goes on changing and progressing until he reaches the ultimate truth. Thus progress is like stepping up on a staircare. 
-- TITO 44 736. ETHIITRITY: 
This maxim is applied to a swift, direct action which is like jumping up to the highest point of a staircase, 
instead of proceeding step by step. 737, pofart: 
A sage called Saubhari married fifty daughters of the king named Mändhāta. He used to have sexual intercourse simultaneously with all these daughters. The maxim speaks of any work of such simultaneous 
action. 738. FRETEROTA: 
The maxim contends that a man of detachment who has attained the supreme knowledge, enjoys undisturbed

sucking its mother's milk. 739. FTASTUTTIR: 
The maxim implies the futility of any work which is like placing a small thin bar on the breast of a woman 
to study the structure of her breast. 740. FatSRITU: 
The old, experienced men may throw a stick, not always at a proper place. The maxim suggests that even an 
experienced person may commit mistake sometimes. 741. Pericht: 
The maxim is based on a practical observation. Rice is being cooked in a pot. Whether the rice is cooked a grain only is tested. So also, an enlightened person knows not only his real nature but also the entire universe. 
--ATO 197 1742. PITARE FAHRITA: 
It is believed that if the Vatsanābha poison (very strong poison) is mixed with the poison of other serpent, the effect of that poison is destroyed. The maxim makes use of this practical phenomenaon when the knowledge about the real shell dawns. The superimposed false 
knowledge of silver is sublated. 743, Peug TITAT: 
When a pillar is to be fixed in the ground it is often shaken to see whether it is properly fixed or not. This example gives rise to the maxim and says, when some topics are discussed in a book, a resume of the earlier topics is taken before embarking on the next topics.

When the star Arundhati is to be pointed out some bigger star near it, is shown first because Arundhati star is very small and it is not easily visible. To indicate subtle things, gross things are pointed out first and then attention is drawn to the subtler things. This is 
what the maxim says. 745. स्नेहदीपन्यायः

If a red flower is kept near a crystal, the crystal appearts to be red because of the nearness of the red object. When that flower or the red object is removed, the crystal resumes its original white colour. The individual self appears to be quite different when it is encased in adjuncts. Once the adjuncts are obliterated, its original 
nature shines. 747. स्त्रोतोनिम्नन्यायः

Pressing one's own breasts implies doing one's own flattery. Secondly the ladies feel very happy when their breasts are pressed by their husbands. They do not get any pleasure if they press their own breasts. Similarly, an inquisitive man does not get any knowledge by pondering over something by himself. Only a teacher can give him the pleasure of getting enlightenment, says the maxim. 
- HO 346 749. For frigefits RITT: 
Once a sage was doing ablutions on the bank of Ganga river. Unexpectedly, a female mouse fell down on his lap. The sage took pity on it and converted it into a beautiful lady and looked after it as his own daugher. He tried hard for a suitable bridegroom but that charm ing damsel didnot like anyone. But when she saw a mouse, she requested the sage to convert her in her previous form again so that she can marry with that mouse. This incident shows that what ever may be his caste he likes it only. Everyone likes his own caste 
whether high or low.. 750. स्वदीपचुम्बनन्यायः 
The maxim gives the example of a person who foolishly kisses a burning lamp, thinking that the lamp is his own. When he went near the lamp, he got some burn injuries to his face, lips and to his moustaches. The purport is to decry the practice of being close to 
somebody, simply because he is his own man. 751. FCUTATETRITET: 
A tiger seen in a dream state vanishes in the wakeful state. That superimposed tiger is sublated. Similarly, the world seems to be true in the state of ignorance, but it is completely sublated when one acquires the knowledge of the Brahman.

752. स्वप्रकाशाश्रयन्यायः 
Though the sun and the sunlight are different, there is a similarity of light or brilliance in them. Therefore, both are supposed to be the same, as they are 
inseparable. The maxim hints at such inseparable quality. 753. स्वभावसिद्धन्यायः | 
घुष्टं घुष्टं पुनरपि पुनश्चन्दनं चारुगन्धं छिन्नं छिन्नं पुनरपि स्वादु चैवेक्षुकाण्डम्। दग्धं दग्धं पुनरपि पुनः काञ्चनं कान्तवर्ण न प्राणान्ते प्रकृतिविकृतिर्जायते द्युत्तमानाम्॥ The sandalwood does not give up its fragrance, even though it is rubbed, broken, cut or pasted. The gold does not give up its lustre or shining even though it is burnt in the burning fire. Similarly, the good people do not give up their nature though put to excruciating trouble. On the strength of these examples the maxim 
speaks about the good behaviour of greatmen. 754. स्वेदजनिमित्तशाटिकत्यागन्यायः 
The insects take their rise in sweat. The clothes are affected by these worms and they are seen occupying all the clothes. Then how thoughtless the act of throwing away all the clothes will be! The maxim is

Laukikanyayakosa

a group of crows may be sitting high up on the top of the mountain, Can there be any comparison between a crow and a swan? Similarly, the maxim suggests that there are many wicked persons in the world and the good are very few. But the number here is not at all 
important. 756. ETRTO: 
The maxim indicates the nature of the good men who accept and appreciate good qualities of men and ignore or give up their faults, by giving the example of a swan which separates water from the milk from their mixture and drinks only the milk leaving the water content behind. 
757. HacTET: 
If a swan enters a flock of cranes, its real worth is not recognised as both are white in colour. When the cranes come to know that he has come all the way from Mānasa lake, they ask him to describe it. The Mānas lake is full of crystal clear watei, golden and precious jewels was the description given by the swan but when the cranes came to know that there are no frogs in the lake, they laugh at the swan and form a very adverse opinion about the lake. The maxim suggests that similarity of colour cannot be a criterian of greatness. The cranes have no idea about the precious jewels--their lustre, value and greatness-so they do not think anything better than the frogs.

A maxim of putting a myrobolan fruit (Amaiakī fruit) on the palm. The truth, being round in shape, canbe seen thoroughly from all sides. The perfect, coniplete knowledge of any man about any object, is compared to the complete knowledge of a myrobolan fruit on the palm of hand. 
-HTO 280 759. feruafferta: 
The maxim suggests that the men who often go to the Brahmaloka have no idea about the Brahmaloka. There is a good deal of wealth in the womb of the earth. But the people walking on the surface of the earth have no 
idea about it. 760. T RAHERITU: 
The maxim intends to paint a picture of a situation when mutually opposite things come together. The idol of Ganeśa is a combination of an elephant and a man. The elephant and the lion partially occupy the bodies of Ganesa and Narasimha partially. The theory of Anekānta of the Jainas is a set of many opposite concepts like is and is not.

Forest and tiger; lake and crocodile promote the existence of other. If they are separated, they will be the victims of the foresters (hunters and fishermen) Their togetherness provide a strong protection to them. The maxim emphasizes that the natural co-existence is always beneficial.
