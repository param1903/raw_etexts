The Pradyumnābhyudaya (“The Felicity of Pradyumna”) is a Sanskrit play in five
acts by King Ravivarman of Kolambapura (Kollam) in Kerala, who lived in the late
13th and early 14th centuries. Its nāyaka or chief hero is Pradyumna, who is at once
the rebirth of Kāmadeva, God of Love, and the first-born son of the Hindu god Kṛṣṇa.
The play recounts the romance of the young Pradyumna with a demon princess na-
med Prabhāvatī, with whom the handsome lad is prompted to fall in love by Kṛṣṇa
as part of a larger plot to destroy Prabhāvatī’s troublesome father Vajraṇābha. Based
on an extensive episode of the Harivaṃśa, the Pradyumnābhyudaya appears to have
been the first brahminical kāvya work to feature Pradyumna as its hero, and the
first work to adapt the Pradyumna-Prabhāvatī romance from the epic-purāṇic to
the kāvya register. The theme then became popular in other compositions in Sans-
krit and various vernaculars over the 15th–19th centuries, such as the Telugu work
Prabhāvatīpradyumnamu of Piṅgaḷi Sūranna.
The Trivandrum Edition and Extant Manuscripts
In 1905, a series of publications began in Thiruvananthapuram, sponsored by the
Maharaja of Travancore Sri Mulam Thirunal Rama Varma VI, making available to
the world the Sanskrit manuscripts of the royal palace library. T. Gaṇapati Śāstrī,
who would come to be best known for his discoveries and work on a set of plays in-
itially thought to be those of Bhāsa, was appointed to oversee these publications and
was the chief editor of dozens of titles in the series to follow — the Trivandrum Sans-
krit Series (anantaśayanasaṃskṛtagranthāvalī, hereafter TSS) — until his death in
1926. The printed volumes made their way to libraries and private collections the
      world over, where they were received with great enthusiasm and interest. These titles
      produced in the early run of printing across the first third of the 20th century are now
      making their way from general circulation to special collections and archives as they
      become increasingly fragile. They have however been preserved in microfilm and
      many are now available on the internet on such sites as archive.org.
      The Pradyumnābhyudaya of Ravivarman was published as volume eight in the
      TSS, and the present text and translation of this play is based directly on this edi-
      tion. Below I will introduce the play’s author, his context, and the work itself. But
      before broaching these issues, it might first of all be asked why a new edition was
      not prepared from the original manuscripts, which are still available at the Oriental
      Research Institute and Manuscripts Library of the University of Kerala. Five manu-
      scripts of the play, all in Malayalam script, are catalogued there as follows (Visalak-
      shy and Girija 1995: 149): (a) and (b) serial 28628 and 28632, from a codex containing
      two manuscripts (MS nos. 15850 B and E) of the Pradyumnābhyudaya along with
      
      
      
      Introduction
      five other works (Unni 1978: 102); (c) serial 28629 = MS no. 20535; (d) serial 28630 =
      MS no. 20536; (e) serial 28631 = MS no. 20537.
      All of these are listed by Visalakshy and Girija as damaged, save for (c). It would
      appear that four of these five were available to and used by T. Gaṇapati Śāstrī, who
      states in the preface to his 1910 TSS edition that his text is based on four manuscripts
      two or three hundred years old, one of which is incomplete. He then identifies them
      as ka, kha, ga and gha (the incomplete manuscript), and in fact never refers in his
      notes to variant readings from gha. Moreover, he gives no more than eighteen short
      variant readings in total, most of them a single word or even a single syllable, and
      none of them in my view having any consequence for the understanding of the play or
      its poetry. I have in any case preserved all of his variant readings in the present text,
      referring to ka, kha and ga as MS1, MS2 and MS3 respectively.
      Taking into consideration the limited number of manuscripts, their apparent uni-
      formity, and the fact that only one damaged manuscript now appears to be available
      beyond those already consulted by Śāstrī, it would not seem that a new edition would
      likely produce a text of the play differing significantly from the TSS rendering. Cer-
      tainly I would not imagine that my own reading of the same manuscripts marshalled
      by so competent a Sanskritist as Śāstrī could produce a better text than he had. And
      yet the current printed editions of the play surviving in library collections have be-
      come fragile and increasingly difficult to access. A PDF scan of the TSS printing
      circulating on the internet is extremely poor, with entire pages missing or illegible,
      and most anusvāras and visargas invisible. Initially working from and correcting
      this source, I prepared a digital roman text of the play, making use of microfilm and
      physical copies from the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin and elsewhere. In the final stages,
      a high-quality scan of the 1910 TSS, which constituted the final proofing author-
      ity, was very kindly made available to me by the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg
      through the efforts of Prof. Dr. Heidrun Brückner.
      King Ravivarman and his Context
      Who then is the author Ravivarman? The first materials for answering this come from
      the play’s opening prastāvanā or prologue between the stage-manager and an actress,
      which provides us some initial information on the nāṭaka’s composer, albeit encoded
      in high self-directed praśasti style: the author of the Pradyumnābhyudaya is the
      learned and heroic King Ravivarman, son of Jayasiṃha ( jayasiṃhasūnu, 1.4) ruler of
      Kolambapura (Quilon or Kollam), claiming descent in the Lunar Lineage (candraku-
      la, 1.2+) as well as the titles “King of the Southern Bhojas” (dakṣiṇabhojarāja, 1.3+)
      and “King of the Yadus” (yadukṣmāpati, 1.5), all of which asserts an ancestral tie to
      the play’s nāyaka or chief hero Pradyumna, the son of Kṛṣṇa and propagator of the
      Vṛṣṇi clan, also known as the Yādavas or descendants of Yadu of the Somavaṃśa. 1
      1
      A more immediate and less mythological sense of Ravivarman’s Yādava identity is examined
      in Vielle 2011.
      
      
      
      3
      Ravivarman also claims the title “Peerless Battlemettle” (saṃgrāmadhīrāpara-,
      1.3+). It is also worth noting that the play is selected by the sūtradhāra after having
      been charged by the learned king’s council with staging a spectacle on the occasi-
      on of the yātrotsava or procession festival of Padmanābha Viṣṇu, the family deity
      of the Yādava kings venerated in the region of Kerala (keraladeśasukṛtapariṇateḥ
      yādavanṛpakuladaivatasya bhagavataḥ śrīpadmanābhasya, 1.2+). This might be re-
      lated to, if not an ancestral form, of the Painkuni and Aurat or Arattu procession
      still carried out today at the Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. It
      is in any case clear that the form of Viṣṇu known as Padmanābha or Lotus-Naveled,
      reclining upon the cosmic serpent Ananta-Śeṣa is of the first importance in the region
      around Thiruvananthapuram (thiru-anantha-puram, see e.g. Aiya 1906: 82–83), and
      our poet-king sets as the occasion for the performance of his play what appears to be
      the procession of a temple image of this same form of Viṣṇu.
      Evidence from beyond the play can be brought to bear, however, which T. Gaṇapati
      Śāstrī (1910: iv–viii) provides in the preface to his TSS edition. Most important here
      are three inscriptions published by Kielhorn and Hultzsch, all of which contain details
      that coordinate directly with the language used at the play’s opening. The first inscrip-
      tion (Kielhorn 1896–97a) is located in the Arulāl Perumal temple in Kanchipuram
      and records Ravivarman’s donation to this temple. Here as well he describes himself
      as the son of Jayasiṃha, descendant in the Lunar Lineage (somānvayottaṃsaka), king
      of the Yadus (nātho yadukṣmābhṛtām), ruler of Kolamba, worshiper of Padmanābha,
      and again he takes the name Saṃgrāmadhīra. Other distinct turns of phrase used in
      both the play’s opening and inscription, such as dharmatarumūlakanda (“the root
      of the tree of religion,” Kielhorn 1896–97a: 148) or dakṣiṇabhojarāja (“king Bhoja
      of the South,” Kielhorn 1896–97a: 148) leave little doubt that it is one and the same
      Ravivarman. However, the inscription also provides the following salient details not
      mentioned in the play: he was born Śaka 1188 (1266/67 CE); his mother was named
      Umādevī; he “defeated the Keralas, Pandyas and Colas,” married a daughter of the
      Pandyas, and was crowned at age 46 on the banks of the Vegavatī. He also refers
      to himself here as Kulaśekharadeva, a phrase that does not occur in the play. Cor-
      roborating this important set of data is a second inscription at Srirangam (Kielhorn
      1896–97b), identical to that at Kanchipuram for the first four verses, and subsequently
      repeating the titles Saṃgrāmadhīra, Kulaśekharadeva, Dakṣiṇabhoja, the Yadu and
      lunar lineage connections, and other phrases. A third inscription (Hultzsch 1905–06)
      is located at the Thiruvadigai Vīraṭṭāneśvara Temple near Panruti, which likewise
      repeats the same text shared by the Kanchipuram and Srirangam inscriptions, but
      also adds the detail in Tamil that, in Śaka 1235 (1313 CE), Ravivarman bathed at
      Vīraṭṭāneśvara and repaired certain stones of the temple.
      Aiyangar (1938–39) provides a detailed analysis of the politics of this period
      and region, and can help us flesh out some of this larger context before, behind and
      around Ravivarman, and the larger struggles between Chera, Pandya and Cola pow-
      ers affecting the Travancore region. Just prior to the birth of Ravivarman, Pandya
      power had gained the upper hand over the fading Cola and eventually two sons of
      
      
      
      Introduction
      the Pandyan ruler Māravarman Kulaśekhara, Sundara and Vīrapandya, fell to strife.
      Sundara won the advantage but maintained only a weak hand upon the Pandya ter-
      ritories, while his brother continued to prove a threat from the margins (Aiyangar
      1938–39: 159–162). At this time — the second quarter of the 13th century or so — the
      port city of Quilon (Kulam or Kolambapuram) was governed as the capital of a small
      kingdom called Kūpaka, independent of Pandya power. Its ruler was Jayasiṃha, to
      whose queen Umā was born our Ravivarman in 1266 or 67. Ravivarman initially
      formed an alliance with the Pandya power by marriage and in so doing attained
      sovereignty over Kerala at the age of 33. This marital alliance seems to have been
      occasioned by Ravivarman’s defeat of one Vikrama Pandya, apparently a rival to
      the Pandyan ruler of the time (Aiyangar 1938–39: 164–165). But it is especially Vīra
      Pandya, the hostile brother of Sundara, whose defeat is touted in the inscriptions we
      have seen above, and this appears to have been an actual victory over Pandya power
      and not a negotiated alliance. It was celebrated by a crowning ceremony when Raviv-
      arman was 46 in 1312 or so. Apparently his rise to power involved negotiating forces
      in his home region and a fractured Pandya regime, which had itself overtaken the
      fading Cola forces — hence his boast of having conquered the Keralas, Pandyas and
      Colas (kṛtvā keralapāṇḍyacolavijayaṃ, Kanchipuram inscr. v.4). He must have held
      power for a time as far East as Kanchipuram. The date and occasion of his demise
      are not clearly recorded, but an inscription in Keralapuram temple by Ravivarman’s
      immediate successor Udayamārtāṇḍa can be taken as an indication that his death
      came in 1312 or 1313 CE (Malini 1992: 46).
      A different source helps to identify the scholarly accomplishments of Ravivar-
      man beyond his composition of the Pradyumnābhyudaya. This is the poet Samudra-
      bandha, who seems to have written in the court of Ravivarman. In his commentary
      on the Alaṅkārasarvasva of Ruyyaka, Samudrabandha credits his patron and king
      Ravivarman as the source for his own commentary and praises him in 58 verses
      (see Malini 1992: 212–225 for full text). And so when Ravivarman makes the claim,
      by way of the naṭī of the play’s prastāvanā (1.3+), to be “vīrasirīe via sarassaīe vi
      ahiramaï” — delighted by the Śrī of victory and of Sarasvatī alike — this is by no
      means empty self-directed praśasti rhetoric. He clearly spoke the language of the
      “Sanskrit cosmopolis” (Pollock 2006), carving his name upon stone and stage alike
      in the decades prior to the establishment of Vijayanagara. While we can assume
      that he saw something of himself in the heroic figure of Pradyumna, with whom he
      asserts a family relationship explicitly, beyond this it might be difficult to argue that
      the particulars of his political biography found expression in the play. 2
      2
      S. Malini has proposed, for example, that Ravivarman’s “war with the Pandyan king and the
      marriage with the daughter of the vanquished enemy are reflected in this drama” (Malini 1992:
      ii), and more directly: “This play is an allegory about the author’s own life, his battle with
      Vikramapāndya, and his marriage with the daughter of the vanquished enemy” (Malini 1992:
      104–105).
      
      
      
      5
      The Play’s Sources
      The source of Ravivarman’s play is an episode from the Harivaṃśa (hereafter HV),
      the khila or supplement to the Mahābhārata which constitutes the earliest continuous
      biography of Kṛṣṇa. The Viṣṇu Purāṇa (cir. 5th century CE) would model its Kṛṣṇa
      biography upon it, and the Viṣṇu in turn would provide the model for the Bhāgavata
      Purāṇa (cir. 9th or 10th century), by far the best known rendering of Kṛṣṇa’s life.
      Until the early 1970s, the form of the HV most commonly used was the so-
      called “Vulgate” (Kinjawadekar 1936), a form of the poem prepared as part of the
      Mahābhārata in the late 17th century by a Marathi Brahmin named Nīlakaṇṭha. But in
      connection with the creation of the Bhandarkar critical edition of the Mahābhārata, a
      critical edition of the HV was prepared by P.L. Vaidya (1969–71), which was signifi-
      cantly shorter than Nīlakaṇṭha’s Vulgate. This critical edition text of the HV repre-
      sents a form of the poem from roughly the 2nd or 3rd century CE (Couture 1991: 72–77;
      Couture 2015: 67–87). Its later additions, expansions and elaborations were organ-
      ized by Vaidya in the manuscript apparatus and appendices (Vaidya 1971, vol. 2). The
      net result was a considerable difference in size between the Vulgate and critical text
      reading, numbering 18,000 vs. 6,073 ślokas respectively (Vaidya 1969: xxxvii). The
      episode taken by Ravivarman as the source of his play is not part of the critical text
      HV, but is rather an appendix, and has a corresponding presence in the Vulgate HV.
      But before treating this source, we will need to understand something about where
      Pradyumna appears in the earlier critical text HV.
      The HV’s title announces its concern with the lineage (vaṃśa) of Kṛṣṇa (Hari),
      and indeed the critical edition text provides two important episodes starring Kṛṣṇa’s
      son Pradyumna (HV 99) and grandson (the son of Pradyumna) Aniruddha (HV 106–
      108). I have studied these episodes closely elsewhere (Austin 2018; Austin 2019;
      Austin forthcoming-b), and so will only mark out here briefly what is relevant for
      our present purposes. HV 99 delivers the root narrative of Kṛṣṇa’s son Pradyumna
      which would be later elaborated in other Brahminical and Jain sources: as soon as
      he is born to Kṛṣṇa’s chief wife Rukmiṇī, Pradyumna is kidnapped by a demon
      proficient in māyā or illusory powers named Śambara. Śambara gives the baby to
      his wife Māyāvatī (lit. “she possessing māyā”) to raise as her own child, and the
      lad grows up without knowing his true parentage. Once arrived at adolescence, he
      proves to be stunningly handsome, and Māyāvatī, overcome with passion for him,
      explains that he is not truly her son: Kṛṣṇa and Rukmiṇī are his true parents. He is
      initially taken aback by her unmotherly advances, but accepts her explanation along
      with her gift of the māyā power she controls. He promptly battles and destroys, by
      means of this māyā, his false father Śambara. He returns with Māyāvatī to Dvārakā,
      where Rukmiṇī and the harem women are astounded to see this handsome young
      man who looks so much like Kṛṣṇa. The true father, who has known all along about
      these goings-on, then appears and confirms that this is his long lost son Pradyumna.
      Kṛṣṇa then adds a final explanatory detail that is of the greatest significance (HV
      99.46): Pradyumna is in fact the rebirth of Kāmadeva, the God of Love (also called
      Kāma, Anaṅga, Manmatha, Madana, Smara, Kusumāyudha, etc.), who had been de-
      
      
      
      Introduction
      stroyed by the rage of Śiva, and Māyāvatī is the rebirth of Kāma’s wife Rati. 3 From
      this point forward in Hindu tradition, Pradyumna is closely associated or identified
      outright with Kāmadeva. The Nāmaliṅgānuśāsana 1.1.25–26 for example identifies
      Kṛṣṇa’s son Pradyumna with over a dozen epithets of Kāmadeva such as Madana,
      Manmatha, Anaṅga, Kāma and so on. In certain sources such as the Brahmavaivarta
      Purāṇa (Kṛṣṇajanmakhāṇḍa 112.8–32), the identification goes so far that Pradyum-
      na’s name is not even used, but only those of the God of Love. Kāma himself of
      course became enormously significant as a symbolic figure and instrument in San-
      skrit kāvya poetry dominated by śṛṅgāra or erotic aesthetics. Only rarely in such
      kāvya literature is the Kāma-Pradyumna identity hinted at, but in Vaiṣṇava sources,
      particularly those telling the life story of Kṛṣṇa, Pradyumna is always celebrated as
      the handsome rebirth of the God of Love.
      A second episode from the critical text HV, the abduction of Aniruddha, bears
      mentioning before we come to Ravivarman’s source. Again, Aniruddha is Pradyum-
      na’s son, who has an experience much like his father (HV 106–108). Very briefly,
      Aniruddha — and he inherits his father’s fabulous good looks, without being iden-
      tified as a form of Kāmadeva — becomes the object of a demon girl’s passion. Uṣā,
      the daughter of the asura Bāṇa, has an intensely erotic dream about a young man
      whom she soon identifies as Aniruddha, and with the assistance of an apsaras named
      Citralekhā, has the lad snatched from Dvārakā and brought to the women’s quarters
      in her father’s palace. Their union is consummated promptly, and this leads almost
      immediately to a confrontation between Aniruddha and Bāṇa when the secret love
      affair has been discovered. Aniruddha fights valiantly but must eventually be res-
      cued by Kṛṣṇa, Saṃkarṣaṇa and Pradyumna (HV 109–113).
      These two critical text episodes — Pradyumna’s birth and maturation narrative
      at HV 99, and Aniruddha’s abduction and union with Uṣā at HV 106–108 — an-
      nounce and celebrate the virility and beauty of Kṛṣṇa’s offspring, and feature them
      both in what might be called table-turning abduction scenarios. Both Pradyumna
      and Aniruddha undergo essentially the same experience: abduction from Dvārakā to
      3
      Very briefly, the well-known burning of Kāmadeva episode begins when the gods come to be
      harrassed by the demon Tāraka, who enjoys the boon that he is invincible to any being, save the
      son of Śiva. The gods send Kāmadeva to awaken Śiva from his meditative trance and arouse
      him to passion and to father a son. In the long run this plan works, but when initially agitated by
      Kāma’s presence, Śiva is furious and burns him to ash on the spot, in most accounts right before
      the eyes of Kāma’s wife Rati. See for example Doniger 1981 [1973]: 141–171 and Benton 2006:
      39–65. The burning of Kāmadeva episode is met with frequently in Purāṇic literature, such
      for example as Vāmana Purāṇa 6.94–107, Matsya Purāṇa 154.271 or Śiva Purāṇa 2.3.27.18–19
      and 60–61. Perhaps the best known source however is from Kālidāsa’s Kumārasaṃbhava 4.42
      and 7.92–93. It should be noted that only occasionally in such Purāṇic sources is the griev-
      ing Rati comforted with the promise that her husband will be reborn as Pradyumna. Perhaps
      the clearest example of this outcome is found at Śiva Purāṇa 2.3.19.37–44. Elsewhere, as in
      Kālidāsa, it is often the fate of Kāmadeva to become Anaṅga or “Bodiless,” still active in the
      world as the prompter of desire, but functioning without physical form.
      
      
      
      7
      the home of an enemy, sexual union in the enemy’s home with a female figure who
      becomes his wife, and consequent conflict with the demon. To be sure, there are a
      number of important differences between HV 99 and HV 106–108, but the motif con-
      spicuously underscored in both episodes is that Kṛṣṇa’s son and grandson are hand-
      some, virile and irresistible to women; their beauty draws women to them, and they
      appropriate these women — audaciously and without inhibition — right from under
      the noses of their (asuric or demonic) protecting males, effectively emasculating or
      cuckolding them before they are conquered outright. Sex and violence are closely
      married together, insofar as the winning over of the female partner is tied directly
      to the subjugation of a problematic demon male, and a kind of double-edged virility
      (sexual and military power) is trumpeted.
      This motif forms the backbone of the HV appendix episode taken up by Ravivar-
      man as the source of his play. Some 420 verses or so, it is labeled in Vaidya’s appen-
      dices as App. I. 29F 4, and corresponds to the Vulgate edition II (Viṣṇuparvan) 91–97.
      Many manuscript colophons identify it as the “Pradyumnottara” or “Vajranābha-
      vadha,” and it constitutes the conclusion of a large sequence of adventures (appendi-
      ces 29–29F, totalling approximately 2,100 verses) elaborated within the larger Kṛṣṇa
      biography between adhyāyas 92 and 93 of the critical HV text, where Kṛṣṇa’s adult
      life in Dvārakā is illustrated.
      HV App. I 29F begins with a common problem in Purāṇic mythology: a trouble-
      some demon who has practiced tapas or asceticism and thereby won from the god
      Brahmā near total invincibility. In this case, the demon’s name is Vajranābha, 5 who
      is impervious to the gods, and resides in an impenetrable city named Vajrapura. Only
      those having the demon’s permission may enter it. Vajranābha challenges Indra in a
      bid to take over heaven, but the latter buys time by citing the fact that Kaśyapa, the
      father of both gods and demons, is conducting a satra sacrifice, and the fight must
      be postponed until its completion. Vajranābha (like so many other Purānic demons,
      a curious combination of hubristic aggression and pious rectitude) agrees to wait.
      Indra then seeks help from Kṛṣṇa who equally explains that his father Vasudeva
      is performing an Aśvamedha or Horse Sacrifice, and Vajranābha’s destruction will
      come once that rite is finished. Pradyumna will be the agent of this destruction by
      means of a kind of Trojan horse maneuver: he will gain access to Vajrapura in the
      guise of an actor (naṭa) in a troop of performers lead by a master director named
      Bhadra. This infiltration plot is paralleled by a second: the stoking of a romance be-
      tween Pradyumna and Vajranābha’s daughter Prabhāvatī. Indra handles this side of
      the undertaking, sending a swan named Śucimukhī to befriend Prabhāvatī and spark
      a passion in her for Pradyumna by relating to her all of his great virtues and physical
      appeal.

      Introduction
      The troop of actors initially performs in a suburb outside of the walled Vajrapura.
      Pradyumna takes the role of nāyaka or principal male hero, Sāmba (another son
      of Kṛṣṇa) that of the fool or vidūṣaka, and Gada (a younger brother of Kṛṣṇa) the
      assistant director (pāripārśva). They perform a synoptic rendering of the Rāmāyaṇa,
      and the old demons who had lived during Rāma’s reign are astounded by the resem-
      blance of the actors to the original figures. In this way Vajranābha comes to hear of
      the extraordinary troop, and formally invites them into the city. There, they set up a
      camp and perform for the demon king:
      Then at the end of the nāndī benediction, Pradyumna recited perfectly a
      śloka appropriate for the Descent of the Gaṅgā, together with the right dra-
      matic gestures (svabhinayānvitam). Then they performed the play called
      Rambhābhisāra by Kubera, with Śūra in the form of Rāvaṇa and Manovatī in
      the guise of Rambhā. Pradyumna was Nalakūbara and Sāmba his vidūṣaka.
      Mount Kailāsa was even magically (māyayā) depicted by those sons of the
      Yadus, along with the curse delivered by the enraged Nalakūbara upon the
      evil Rāvaṇa, and the manner in which Rambhā was comforted. The heroes,
      the joy of the Yadus, enacted this drama (prakaraṇaṃ), the kīrti of the
      great-souled, all-knowing sage Nārada. 6 Because of their excellent footwork
      (pādoddhāreṇa), acting (nṛtyena), and gestures and expressions (abhinayena),
      the heroic demons rewarded the Bhaimas [Vṛṣṇis] of unlimited splendour (HV
      App. I 29F lines 284–295).
      Pradyumna is now in the city, “disguised as an actor” (but is clearly a master perfor-
      mer, and so is not truly acting — or perhaps we should say is truly acting), and the
      dūta swan Śucimukhī sets up the rendez-vous for the two young lovers, who have yet
      to meet, but who by word of mouth are now longing ardently for each other. Prady-
      umna, master of māyā, disguises himself as a bee and enters Prabhāvatī’s chamber
      on a bouquet of flowers, but soon reveals himself and the pair perform a Gāndharva
      or love-by-consummation marriage. Over the next several days, he continues to visit
      undetected his new wife’s bedchamber thanks to a māyic double of himself that he
      projects and leaves in the actor’s camp. His brother Sāmba and uncle Gada have also
      paired surreptitiously with demon princesses.
      Shortly before the inevitable conflict with Vajranābha, Pradyumna sings to
      Prabhāvatī a triṣṭubh hymn to the moon and rainy season, now reaching its end.
      As the rains conclude, so do Kaśyapa’s and Vasudeva’s ritual undertakings, and all
      three demon princesses give birth to sons. Pradyumna’s affair — as well as those
      of Sāmba and Gada — are discovered by the demon king when these newborns are
      spotted by his guards. Prabhāvatī, wholly embracing her new identity as a Vṛṣṇi
      and mother in the lunar dynasty, encourages Pradyumna to go forth and destroy her
      6
      As the play Rambhābhisāra is credited to Kubera (Harivaṃśa App. I 29F line 286), it seems
      here that kīrti may refer to the time measure of the music, associated with Nārada.

      father Vajranābha, telling him he need fear nothing as she has been blessed with the
      boon of never becoming a widow. The spectacular battle between Pradyumna and
      Vajranābha is witnessed by the gods, and involves Sāmba and Gada, at times aided
      by Indra, defeating subsidiary forces of the demon army such as Vajranābha’s brother
      Sunābha. Māyic attacks are sent and neutralized, and the final moment arrives when
      Pradyumna, mounted upon Garuḍa and as such nearly indistinguishable from his
      avatāra father, sends forth Kṛṣṇa’s cakra to decapitate Vajranābha. The conquering
      heroes are consecrated and given sovereignty over various domains.
      While the temporal and geographical provenance of the HV’s many appendices are
      often difficult, if not impossible, to date, this “Pradyumnottara” adventure forms part
      of a block of appendices (HV App. I 29–29F) that have been dated with at least some
      certainty by Horst Brinkhaus. In his 1987 study of the Pradyumna narrative in the Ne-
      pal area, Brinkhaus concludes that “[t]he Indian version of the Pradyumna-Prabhāvatī
      legend as handed down in the Hv was already known in Nepal in the twelfth century,
      and perhaps as early as the first half of the eleventh” (Brinkhaus 1987: 92). Vaidya
      notes that the entire block of appendices 29–29F is unknown to Kṣemendra, and so
      dates them to after 1050 CE or so (Vaidya 1969: xxxiii). I would add that the ma-
      jor Purāṇas retelling Kṛṣṇa’s life story, particularly the Viṣṇu and Bhāgavata, do not
      know this episode. Its origins seem to be very late in the first millenium, or in the early
      centuries of the second. It is found widely in most of Vaidya’s HV manuscripts both
      northern and southern, being absent only from Ś1, Ñ1, Ñ3, and M1–3. As such it cannot
      confidently be identified with any particular region of South Asia.
      Yet another source of interest is the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣa of Hemacandra (12th cen-
      tury), which delivers a rendering of the Pradyumna saga typical of most Jain sources,
      but which also involves a scenario, not shared in earlier Jain sources, that resonates
      conspicuously with the HV App. I 29F material. In Hemacandra’s text (8.7.38–85),
      Pradyumna’s mother Rukmiṇī seeks to arrange her son’s marriage with a daughter of
      her brother Rukmin, but the latter contemptuously rejects the proposal. Pradyumna
      then wins over the young woman as bride by taking the disguise of a caṇḍāla musi-
      cian, who charms his way into the king’s city and gains access to the king’s daugh-
      ter. Keeping the guise of the outcast minstrel, he stokes the young woman’s passion
      for “Pradyumna” through song and flattering description, not yet revealing his true
      identity to her. Eventually Pradyumna uses his Vidyā power (the Jain counterpart of
      māyā in the HV) to enter the princess’s quarters, where in his true handsome form
      he marries and makes love to her. Her affair is discovered, causing great uproar and
      scandal, but the union is soon recognized and blessed by Rukmin, who has in the
      meantime had a change of heart regarding Pradyumna. Clearly no simple transpos-
      ition of the HV source, the 12th century Jain episode nonetheless shares a basic story
      arc involving surreptitious entry into a hostile king’s city in the guise of a performing
      artist, stoking the passion of his daughter through flattering description, under-the-
      radar consummation of the union in the women’s quarters, and final conflict (albeit
      resolved here amicably). This source does not significantly predate Ravivarman him-
      self in the late 13th or early 14th century, but it certainly does seem to suggest that
      
      
      
      Introduction
      something much like HV App. I 29F had become, by the 12th century, a popular part
      of the legends of Kṛṣṇa’s son in both Brahminical and Jain circles.
      Whatever may be the text’s precise date, Ravivarman knew and had access to
      manuscripts of the HV’s Prabhāvatī episode, and if we turn now to a synopsis of his
      play, it will become readily apparent what the author has retained, and what he has
      modified from this HV source.
      Synopsis of the Play
      The play’s opening nāndī consists of two verses invoking the blessings of Viṣṇu,
      and in the ensuing dialogue between sūtradhāra and naṭī it is established that the
      yātrotsava or procession-festival of Padmanābha Viṣṇu is at hand. For this occa-
      sion, the highly learned members of the court of King Ravivarman have asked
      that a spectacle be prepared, and the director chooses the king’s own composition,
      Pradyumnābhyudaya, for this purpose.
      The prologue transitions into Act One proper by means of a śleṣa or double-
      entendre verse celebrating Kṛṣṇa and the springtime, and Kṛṣṇa and Nārada appear.
      Soon the principal problem around which the play turns is established: a demon na-
      med Vajraṇābha is out of control, maddened by boons from Brahmā and nearly un-
      touchable in his fabulous city Vajrapura. Pradyumna will be the means to destroy
      the demon, and moreover a romance with Vajraṇābha’s daughter Prabhāvatī will be
      encouraged. Bhadranaṭa, a master performer, is summoned — he will assist Prady-
      umna in entering the demon’s city. The particulars of this strategy are not spoken
      aloud, but whispered in Bhadranaṭa’s ear. It will become clear subsequently that the
      whispered plot chiefly involves Pradyumna and other Vṛṣṇis posing as actors in a
      travelling theatre group, while Bhadranaṭa engineers the passion of Prabhāvatī for
      Pradyumna. A call to noonday rites precipitates the end of the act.
      Act Two centers on Prabhāvatī and the awakening of her passion for Pradyum-
      na, whom she will not see in person until Act Three. The prologue establishes that
      Prabhāvatī is learning dance and music from Bhadranaṭa, and that she is an exceed-
      ingly gifted student. Bhadranaṭa had entered Vajrapura by invitation, along with his
      group of actors, after performing outside the city and being well received there. The
      principal material of the act then unfolds: Prabhāvatī and her friend Kalahaṃsikā
      discuss a drawing which Kalahaṃsikā has found of the most extraordinary man they
      have ever seen. The picture had in fact been planted by Bhadranaṭa precisely so that
      Kalahaṃsikā would find it and show it to Prabhāvatī. The two of them speculate on
      the identity of the man — he is surely the God of Love himself — and who might
      have drawn the picture. Kalahaṃsikā decides that the artist must have been Bha-
      dranaṭa, and they summon him. On his way to them, Bhadranaṭa remarks on the
      spectacular splendour of the city. The two young women cautiously approach the
      subject of the man in the drawing. Eventually it is revealed that he is Pradyumna, the
      son of Kṛṣṇa, and Bhadranaṭa is delighted to see his plan is working: Prabhāvatī is
      
      
      
      11
      clearly becoming impassioned over this young man and wishes to see him in person.
      Bhadranaṭa promises to arrange this.
      Act Three opens with a mixed dialogue between Bhadranaṭa and Kalahaṃsikā,
      who speak about the lovesick Prabhāvatī. She is already beside herself with passion,
      but has yet to see Pradyumna in person. A play is about to be performed for the king,
      however, and by this means Pradyumna and Prabhāvatī can behold each other. King
      Vajraṇābha enters with his courtiers, including the learned and perceptive Haṃsa,
      as well as Prabhāvatī and Kalahaṃsikā. The demon is eager to begin his campaign
      against Indra and scoffs at the notion that Indra can be protected by the human Kṛṣṇa,
      but Haṃsa is nervous and knows that his king is underestimating his foes. Haṃsa
      in fact has heard it said that Pradyumna will be the downfall of Vajraṇābha. The
      arrogant king calls for the play to begin, and after an invocatory verse to Kāmadeva,
      Bhadranaṭa and Pradyumna take the stage in the roles, respectively, of vidūṣaka and
      the nāyaka Nalakūbara. The play will be the Rambhābhisaraṇa. Before the play even
      begins, Pradyumna is overwhelmed by seeing Prabhāvatī in the audience and, in
      asides to Bhadranaṭa, falls to pining over her. Bhadranaṭa prompts him to get the
      play underway. The plot of the nested play is very simple: Nalakūbara with his fool is
      awaiting a tryst with his lover Rambhā, an apsaras. She is delayed and he expresses
      concern, and is tortured with pangs of love exacerbated by the rising moon. When
      Rambhā does arrive, it is in a state of the utmost distress, having been raped by the
      demon Rāvaṇa while en route to Nalakūbara. The latter comforts her and turns to the
      rear of the stage, hurling invective upon Rāvaṇa (who does not appear on stage) and
      finally a ritually enacted curse: Rāvaṇa’s head will split into a hundred pieces if ever
      again he seizes an unwilling woman. All of this is enacted with many asides from
      the audience — the king, Haṃsa, Prabhāvatī and Kalahaṃsikā chat amongst them-
      selves and remark upon the skill of the actors, the beauty of Nalakūbara, and so on.
      In fact when the character Rambhā cries out in distress from backstage, Vajraṇābha
      swaggers in rage and indignation at the thought of anyone assaulting a woman in his
      presence, and must be reminded by Haṃsa that it is all just a play. At the end of the
      piece, Pradyumna, still in his role as Nalakūbara, pronounces a final bharatavākya or
      benedictory verse which is in fact a śleṣa encoding a second sinister meaning promis-
      ing death for King Vajraṇābha. Only Haṃsa perceives this. He is shocked and greatly
      distressed by it, but does not inform the king. As the act concludes, Prabhāvatī and
      Kalahaṃsikā discuss a plan to meet Pradyumna in person in the outer garden.
      Act Four takes place in the outer garden. A chamberlain describes the miseries
      of the hot season and Prabhāvatī’s continuing love pangs. The two young women
      then enter, and we learn that the lovers have in fact had a second occasion to behold
      each other during the Madana festival. Prabhāvatī is not convinced that the passion
      is mutual. She assumes that if Pradyumna shows signs of love, it must be on ac-
      count of another woman. Kalahaṃsikā does her best to convince her friend that it is
      she, Prabhāvatī, whom he loves. Bhadranaṭa is presently bringing him to meet her.
      Meanwhile Bhadranaṭa and Pradyumna enter, as yet unseen by the young women,
      and Pradyumna likewise is pining and despondent, not quite able to believe that
      
      
      
      Introduction
      Prabhāvatī reciprocates his affection. A final round of tortured love verses from both
      Prabhāvatī and Pradyumna create a kind of chorus of agony, and Pradyumna at last
      bursts in upon her and declares his love. After some pleasantries and teasing, Bha-
      dranaṭa recommends a Gāndharva or impromptu marriage by mutual consent. The
      two are simply but officially married, and are given some privacy by Bhadranaṭa and
      Kalahaṃsikā. Pradyumna gently attempts to kiss the shy Prabhāvatī but his efforts
      are soon thwarted by a summons for Prabhāvatī to return to her mother the queen.
      The fifth and final act is opened by Bhadranaṭa’s descriptions of the end of the
      rainy season, to which Pradyumna himself is poetically likened. Kṛṣṇa and Nārada
      appear, and carry through the bulk of the remaining action by describing to each
      other in verse events that have already taken place — namely the shocking discov-
      ery of Pradyumna’s presence in the women’s quarters and the demon army’s initial
      attempt to destroy him — and those then transpiring off-stage which are described.
      Vajraṇābha faces off against Pradyumna, and is assisted by his brother Sunābha.
      Gada and Sāmba come to assist Pradyumna, as do Indra and his elephant Airāvata.
      Nārada relays directly to Kṛṣṇa the taunts and threats uttered by the demon king to
      Pradyumna and a series of magical weapons are then deployed by Vajraṇābha and
      neutralized by Pradyumna. The lad is struck down by a blow from a mace, but he
      recovers himself and summons the cakra weapon which decapitates the demon while
      the gods, delighted, watch from above. Pradyumna, Gada and Sāmba soon appear to
      greet Kṛṣṇa and Nārada and receive their praises and congratulations for their feat.
      Bhadranaṭa enters and announces the birth of three boys to the three demon princess-
      es. Pradyumna is then consecrated lavishly as universal emperor.
      Clearly Ravivarman has followed the HV source closely. On a number of occa-
      sions he lifts ślokas directly with little or no modification (e.g. 1.14, 1.16). But of
      course a number of changes have been made: there are no more swan messengers,
      and Kalahaṃsikā is created to a certain extent to take the place of Śucimukhī. The
      poet also introduces the character Haṃsa (“Swan”), and expands the theatrical per-
      formance of the Rambhābhisāra delivered in Vajrapura (see below), which is not said
      in the HV to be attended by Prabhāvatī or serve as an occasion for them to see each
      other. The union now takes place (without the magical recourse to any bee disguise
      on Pradyumna’s part) in an outer garden rather than the inner antaḥpura chambers,
      and a picture of Pradyumna plays a role which it did not in the HV. Certain passages
      of the source, such as Pradyumna’s substantial hymn to the rainy season and moon,
      have no direct equivalent in the play.
      Conventions of Sanskrit Drama and the garbhāṅka
      My concern above was with the play’s sources: the immediate source in HV App. I
      29F, which in turn rests upon or responds in a sense to an earlier source, namely those
      other portions of the HV concerning Pradyumna and his son Aniruddha which we
      now identify as the much earlier critical text episodes of adhyāyas 99 and 106–108.
      The appendix 29F and Ravivarman’s play carry forward and elaborate the fundamen-
      
      
      
      13
      tal mythic dynamics of Pradyumna, echoed by his son, from his earliest narrative
      episode, which again involves a coordinated celebration of his sexual and military po-
      wer: the conquest of a troublesome demon (Śambara in HV 99, Bāṇa in HV 106–108,
      Vajranābha in HV App. I 29F) is tied intimately to the acquisition of a new sexual
      partner (Māyāvatī, Uṣā, Prabhāvatī) for the handsome son or grandson of Kṛṣṇa.
      But in a very different sense, it can be said that the play’s other sources are the
      cumulative canon of Sanskrit drama up to the 13th century. That is, Ravivarman’s
      play is highly conventional and draws directly on the themes, motifs, stock scenarios
      and dynamics of Kālidāsa, Harṣa, Bhavabhūti and so on. As Malini demonstrates,
      the composition of Sanskrit dramas in the Kerala region itself was minimal prior
      to Ravivarman (Malini 1992: 2–5), but the king was clearly on intimate terms with
      such works as the Mālavikāgnimitra, Ratnāvalī and Uttararāmacarita, and readers
      familiar with these pieces will immediately recognize many familiar scenes and pat-
      terns: a painted picture, servants appearing and disappearing with messages for the
      king or queen, calls to noonday rituals that conclude an act; an eavesdropping lover
      tortured by the misunderstood meaning of his lover’s words; dūta or messenger char-
      acters stoking the passion of a couple who have yet to meet; the karṇe stage whisper
      communicating a strategic plot, the unfolding of which we then witness; festivals of
      Kāmadeva, the springtime, or other seasonal celebrations; a secret meeting of lovers
      in a grove of vines and flowers; the final crowning of a prince at the play’s termina-
      tion, etc. Those familiar with Sanskrit drama will recognize these and other themes
      that circulate through the canon, and will find, I think, that they are quite masterfully
      deployed through the poet’s rendering of the HV App. I 29F episode. One such theat-
      rical convention, however, deserves a little more of our attention — the garbhāṅka
      or “womb-act.”
      Act Three of the Pradyumnābhyudaya consists principally of a garbhāṅka, a
      “play-within-the-play” or abyme performance the likes of which one encounters in
      theatrical traditions the world over (those familiar with English theater will think
      first of Hamlet 3.2) and not infrequently in Sanskrit drama. 7 One of the best-known
      garbhāṅkas is Kālidāsa’s Mālavikāgnimitra 2.2, in which the heroine Mālavikā com-
      municates her love for King Agnimitra through the medium of a staged perform-
      ance. Agnimitra observes her “Chalita” scene and understands her encoded feel-
      ings, directed towards him but ostensibly merely part of the public spectacle. The
      Priyadarśikā of Harṣa similarly plays out a garbhāṅka scene in which Āraṇyakā
      (Priyadarśikā) and King Udayana are able to communicate a mutual love on stage
      which cannot yet be publically expressed (albeit in a more complex mode than
      Mālavikā’s to Agnimitra). Similarly in Act Seven of the Uttararāmacarita of Bhav-
      abhūti, Rāma witnesses and is utterly devastated by a staged depiction of the trials of
      Sītā, pregnant and banished to the forest by his own decree. His distressed reaction
      prompts Lakṣmaṇa to remind him “ārya ! nāṭakam idaṃ”, (Uttararāmacarita 7.2+)
      7

      Introduction
      — “Noble Sir, it’s [only] a play!” Elsewhere in Sanskrit drama, spectators — often
      seeing scenes of their own life on stage — forget where they are and respond to
      garbhāṅka performances with passion and profound affective investment. Again,
      if the example of Hamlet is helpful, we might call this the “Claudius Effect” of the
      garbhāṅka. Here in the Pradyumnābhyudaya, Vajraṇābha, although not witnessing a
      scene of his own life, reacts in this stereotyped way. His response to Rambhā’s cries
      is much like that of Rāvaṇa in the Bālarāmāyaṇa of Rājaśekhara Act Three, where
      the demon king blusters in fury when hearing related, in a garbhāṅka performance,
      the virtues of other suitors to Sītā’s hand, and must be told that “it’s just a play”
      (prekṣaṇakam idam, Bālarāmāyaṇa 3.67+).
      While some levity is provided by spectators like Vajraṇābha getting carried away
      with the performances they take in, the nested plays of Sanskrit drama function in
      powerful ways to communicate the deepest purposes and identities of their principal
      characters. Often in combination with the śleṣa or double-meaning verse form, they
      constitute true abymes in the sense articulated by Dällenbach, who has studied the
      form most extensively in the European context: “est mise en abyme toute enclave
      entretenant une relation de similitude avec l’œuvre qui la contient” (Dällenbach 1977:
      18). Between the content of a garbhāṅka micro play and that of its framing macro ma-
      terial one finds either tautological self-reference — a concentrated narrative doubling,
      featuring the macro character’s own life and experience — or a thematically pregnant
      one which resonates immediately with or points directly to the macro narrative.
      Ravivarman’s Act Three garbhāṅka is the Rambhābhisāra, a short prekṣaṇaka
      based on a scene of Vālmīki’s Rāmāyaṇa. I provide in Appendix 1 of this volume a
      full translation of the Vālmīki passage in question, namely Rāmāyaṇa 7.26. As we
      have seen, this is not invented but forms part already of the HV App. I 29F source, the
      relevant portion of which I have translated in full above (HV App. I 29F lines 284–
      295). We see that the HV does not go so far as to give the actual text performed, and
      so Ravivarman, well aware of the power of garbhāṅkas, fully unpacks this drama,
      making it the centrepiece of his own. I have examined elsewhere how and why the
      Rambhābhisāra speaks meaningfully to the macro context of the Pradyumnābhyu-
      daya (Austin 2019). In the restricted context of this introduction, it will suffice to ob-
      serve the following: while Vajraṇābha is Prabhāvatī’s father, and so is not a contender
      for her hand in any romantic sense, Pradyumna’s romance with the demon princess
      is not simply a secondary adventure running alongside the principal purpose of her
      father’s destruction. In HV 99, 106–108 and App. I 29F, there is at work a conspicu-
      ous and deeply gendered power dynamic premised on the notion that the “protec-
      tion” of women is a fundamental gage of masculinity: a man who cannot protect
      “his” women (daughters, wives, mothers) is no man at all. In all of these narratives,
      Pradyumna and Aniruddha bring about the defeat of demonic males by audaciously
      taking sexual possession of a female (wife or daughter) purportedly under his pro-
      tection. The demon male confronts his enemy once the humiliating discovery of the
      surreptitious love affair is revealed, signalling the sexual power of the Vṛṣṇi hero
      which naturally is matched by his power on the battlefield.
      
      
      
      15
      In setting the Rambhābhisāra at the center of his work, Ravivarman intensifies and
      underscores this dynamic of the macro Pradyumna-Vajraṇābha-Prabhāvatī triangle,
      mapping it against the explicitly agonistic micro one: Rāvaṇa rapes Rambhā; Na-
      lakūbara emasculates Rāvaṇa with a curse that will bring immediate death as a con-
      sequence of any future sexual violence on his part. The conflict between Pradyumna
      and Vajraṇābha is not to be resolved simply by the violent domination of one over
      the other; it involves necessarily the stake of a feminine figure whom only one man
      may possess or protect, and her passing from Rāvaṇa or Vajranābha to Nalakūbara
      or Pradyumna signals the humiliating defeat of the former and triumphal sexual and
      military power of the latter.
      This is precisely what Vajraṇābha’s courtier Haṃsa is so shocked to discover
      when hearing the garbhāṅka’s bharatavākya or closing benedictory verse, which in
      fact is a śleṣa with the most sinister overtones: may Vajraṇābha perish and Pradyum-
      na, the God of Love, take possession of his śrī or royal splendour (importantly, a fem-
      inine noun which can be understood as an abstract property of feminine felicity and
      wealth, or as the very goddess Śrī-Lakṣmī herself). Again, such śleṣas often function
      fruitfully in the context of dramatic garbhaṅkas: “Most typically, śleṣa appears as a
      verbal extension of some physical guise in connection with the question of a person’s
      true identity” (Bronner 2010: 88). Speaking of the key śleṣa verse in the garbhāṅka
      of Harṣa’s Priyadarśikā (3.12), Shulman remarks: “[I]t is here, in the śleṣa mode, that
      the hero will finally speak his longing in an active, and affective, state of temporary
      self-coalescence. One might go so far as to define the peculiar subjectivity present
      in the embedded drama as just this form of unexpected self-coincidence, in which
      the normative disjunctions and unaligned perceptions that comprise awareness are
      superseded by a continuous, expressive, expansive self-embrace” (Shulman 1997:
      83). Ravivarman understood Pradyumna’s mythic identity as both the God of Love
      — virile, impossibly beautiful and charged with sexual power — and as the son of the
      dharma-restoring avatāra — Vṛṣṇi warrior, hero and slayer of demons. Pradyumna
      is himself a kind of śleṣa figure, the perfect embodiment of both śṛṅgāra and vīra
      rasas, and Ravivarman uses the Rambhābhisāra drama to sharpen our understand-
      ing of this crucial feature of his nāyaka’s identity.
      Literary Aspects of the Play
      The Pradyumnābhyudaya may, like any other drama, be analyzed according to the
      categories established by Bharata and other thinkers concerned with aesthetics and
      dramatic form. Malini (1992) provides many helpful points with respect to the ap-
      plication to the play of such theoretical categories as vastu, netṛ, rasa and so on.
      The Pradyumnābhyudaya is for example a nāṭaka in form (1.3+); its nāyaka hero
      is indeed a royal figure of the dhīroddātta type (Malini 1992: 31–33; 119–127) as
      prescribed by tradition (brave and noble, as opposed for example to the brave but
      proud dhīroddhata hero). But Malini’s observations on the play’s rasas are particu-
      larly worth remarking on.
      
      
      
      Introduction
      The dominant rasas are vīra or heroic and śṛṅgāra or erotic, the former taking
      precedence over the latter (Malini 1992: 97). The final act, consisting largely of verse
      descriptions, spoken by Kṛṣṇa and Nārada, of the Pradyumna-Vajraṇābha battle tran-
      spiring off-stage, are a veritable kośa of vīrarasa poetry. But of course much time is
      spent by the poet in earlier acts squeezing every drop of śṛṅgara sap from the source
      material offering such enormous potential: the God of Love himself, reborn as the
      son of the dharma-restoring avatāra, as the hero of a double victory in love and war.
      However, Malini points out that the play’s very title points to the predominance of
      vīra; had it been śṛṅgāra, it should have been called the Pradyumnapariṇaya (Ma-
      lini 1992: 101), and similarly according to convention, the Gāndharva marriage of
      Pradyumna and Prabhāvatī would follow after the destruction of Vajraṇābha were
      śṛṅgāra the dominant rasa (Malini 1992: 102–103). The finer theoretical distinctions
      made concerning the workings-out of śṛṅgāra rasa across various stages of fulfill-
      ment, such as āyoga and viprayoga vipralamba can likewise be identified at work in
      the play (Malini 1992: 109–113). She also identifies as subsidiary but important the
      raudra (furious) and adbhuta (wonder) rasas (Malini 1992: 113–115).
      In terms of narrative structure, Warder (2004: 891) likewise notes briefly the prog-
      ress of the drama through the five conventional sandhis or stages (mukha, pratimukha,
      garbha, vimarśa and nirvahaṇa). In short, those familiar with the theoretical con-
      structs of Sanskrit drama and aesthetics will find ample evidence of Ravivarman’s
      fluency with the genre and its secondary discursive literature.
      The Pradyumna-Prabhāvatī Theme in Later Literature
      As far as I have been able to determine, Ravivarman’s play was the first kāvya work
      to take up the HV App. I 29F material, and moreover seems to be the first or oldest
      extant Brahminical kāvya work featuring Pradyumna as its hero. For some time pri-
      or, Jain authors had been celebrating a distinct tradition of Pradyumna stories (Austin
      2019; see also Alsdorf 1936) in both their own Purāṇic traditions of Kṛṣṇa’s life such
      as the Harivaṃśapurāṇa of Jinasena, and in Jain kāvya works such as Mahāsena’s
      Pradyumnacarita (10th century CE) or Siṃha’s 12th century Pajjuṇṇacariu. These
      however did not involve the Prabhāvatī story, but were all based on the Purāṇic Jain
      rendering — much altered and expanded — of the HV 99 scene centering on Māyāvatī
      and Śambara, which formed a discrete narrative cycle called the Pradyumnacarita
      within the larger context of the Jain Kṛṣṇa and Mahābhārata narratives. Brahminical
      tradition carried forward the tales of Kṛṣṇa’s son largely in the venue of the Purāṇas
      such as the Viṣṇu and Bhāgavata (Austin forthcoming-a), and in the later additions
      to the HV. But in the centuries after Ravivarman, the Prabhāvatī romance appears to
      have become a popular theme in Sanskrit and vernacular kāvya, exemplified by such
      works as the Prabhāvatīpariṇaya of Viśvanātha Kāvirāja (14th century, unpublished),
      Prabhāvatīpariṇaya of Harihara (15th century, unpublished), Pradyomnoṭṭaracariṭa
      of Mṛtyuñjaya (16th century, unpublished), the Prabhāvatīpradyumnamu of Piṅgali
      Sūraṇa (16th century; see Rao and Shulman 2006), Pradyumnānad[īy]a Bhāna of
      
      
      
      17
      Veṅkaṭācārya (17th century, unpublished), Prabhāvatīpradyumna of Rāmakṛṣṇa Sūri
      (17th century or later, unpublished), and others. I cannot offer any evidence that Ra-
      vivarman inspired this trend — indeed the theme from the HV appendix might very
      well have presented itself as a rich source for poetry and drama to kavis unfamiliar
      with the Pradyumnābhyudaya. I should however be especially intrigued to discover
      evidence of any Brahminical kāvya work, prior to Ravivarman, which features Pra-
      dyumna as its chief figure, whether based on the HV 99 or the App. I 29F narrative.
      Translation and Annotation
      Translations of the play have been published in Malayalam (Rāmannampūtiri 1934)
      and Telugu (Sundararāma 1952), but so far as I am aware the present English trans-
      lation is the first in a European language. I have encountered very little scholarship
      on the play itself beyond Warder’s treatment (2004: 882–892) and S. Malini’s 1992
      thesis, to which I have referred above. The latter remarks that two theses by S. Sub-
      ramonia Iyer and Nilakandan “deal with this drama briefly, but no indepth [sic] study
      has been made” (Malini 1992: ii). Malini’s thesis is informative, and assists in the
      contextualization of certain passages, but contains very little direct translation of
      material from the play. As such I hope by the present effort to make widely available
      a masterful work of Sanskrit literature little known outside its home region of Kerala.
      To define briefly my posture as translator, it may suffice to say that I have sought
      to navigate a middle course between, on the one hand, a stilted, broken or over-cau-
      tious rendering, and on the other an overly liberal handling of the text. Readers will
      note as well my minimal use of translation apparati such as rounded and squared
      brackets, the latter being used chiefly for expanding Śāstrī’s notations on manuscript
      variations. The English rendering and annotation to the translation are directed to-
      wards a non-specialist audience. As the Sanskrit text accompanies the translation
      and may be consulted easily by the reader, I have opted for more generic English ren-
      derings of terms that might otherwise remain untranslated (deva, asura, gāndharva,
      svayaṃvara, etc.). In rendering verses, I have sought as much as possible to preserve
      the general structure of padas, and have largely but not universally been successful
      in mirroring their sequence in English. Occasionally, I have felt the need to unpack
      śleṣa verses in annotation (e.g. 2.6). The Sanskrit chāyā for the Prakrit is provided in
      the footnotes. I have introduced into them the mūla text stage directions in Sanskrit.
      The TSS editor Śāstrī remarks that none of his manuscripts contained a chāyā text,
      and so this Sanskrit rendering is his own which I reproduce here.
      I have been especially committed to publishing the original Sanskrit along with
      my English not only because a new text of the play is needed, but precisely because
      of my keen awareness that better Sanskritists than I will see what I have not seen,
      will take issue with some of my readings and renderings, or otherwise bring finer
      reading tools and skills to this work than I have been able to do. If in the end the
      Pradyumnābhyudaya becomes better known and studied than it has to date, I shall
      consider the effort more than worthwhile. While of course accepting total ownership

      Although the most natural candidate for a vidūṣaka role, Bhadranaṭa only plays the fool in the
      garbhāṅka (as a Brahmin named Bhadrāṅka), but not in the principal drama (see Malini 1992:
      132–133).

      of King Ravivarman
      Act One
      (enter Bhadranaṭa)
      Bhadranaṭa ― (reflectively):
      1
      May that Blessed Lord Puruṣottama of extraordinary virtue increase your
      welfare —
      he who took for his wife, even as the gods and demons of unlimited power
      watched from afar,
      the auspicious Goddess Śrī, born from the churning of the ocean
      and herself like the miraculous embodiment of felicity and prosperity.
      and also:
      2
      For the blessing of all auspicious things, we contemplate this particular
      majesty:
      him with the body of a man and the face of a lion, uncontained in the
      jeweled column,
      whose hand, soon to wear as a bracelet the entrails of the lord of the demon
      family,
      looks as though it had bound upon it an amulet for ensuring the protection of
      the world. 218
      (after the opening verse of praise, the stage manager enters)
      218 Verse 1.1 invokes Viṣṇu on the occasion of the churning of the ocean (see for example Viṣṇu
      Purāṇa 1.9), a cosmogonic act performed by the gods and demons alike which produced,
      among other things, Śrī-Lakṣmī. The goddess is desired by all, but places herself at the side
      of Viṣṇu. Verse 1.2 meanwhile invokes Viṣṇu’s Narasiṃha or man-lion form (e.g. Bhāgavata
      Purāṇa 7.8), a far more violent manifestation who bursts forth from a column and disembow-
      els the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu. The two verses together anticipate the fundamental persona of
      the play’s hero Pradyumna, in whom are married the śṛṅgāra and vīra rasas: Pradyumna will
      obtain the auspicious princess Prabhāvatī and violently destroy the demon Vajraṇābha.
      
      
      

      Stage Manager — (walking about and looking backstage) My Lady! Come here
      please!
      (enters)
      Actress — Sir! Here I am!
      Stage Manager — My Lady! I have been appointed by the King’s Council, which
      serves the lotus feet of King Ravivarman — master of all the sixty-four
      arts, the very glory of the auspiciousness of the Lunar lineage, whose
      sovereignty extends out in all directions like a crown over his subordinated
      vassals, who is himself the root and foundation of the tree of dharma which
      depends upon the various Vedic branches, a wish-fulfilling jewel to his
      friends and the perfect adornment of Kolamba City — as follows: ‘Today we
      are to be entertained by the performance of some new play or other on the
      occasion of the procession festival of the Blessed Lord Padmanābha, who
      is the very cause of the creation, sustenance and dissolution of the entire
      world, whose palm is a jeweled slab between arms reddened by the morning
      sun of Kaśmīr, upon the pitcher-like breasts of the maiden produced by
      the churning of the cosmic ocean of milk, by whom the Southern ocean is
      rendered auspicious by the abundance of splendour from his ceaselessly
      yawning form, whose charming moon-face is bound together in union with
      the rays of light from the ruby gem upon the hood of that king of snakes who
      serves as his couch, to whom bows piously the region of Kerala, the family
      deity of the Yādava Kings.’ 219
      Actress — (joyfully) Sir! Great indeed is the sophistication of this council where
      performing arts are concerned. Surely, Sir, you will achieve a venerable
      fame there displaying your mastery as a performer!
      Stage Manager — My Lady! Do not say such things!
      3
      Propitiating with many skills an assembly rapt with attention,
      any actor can get a good reception.
      Actress — Just so, Sir! A person like yourself surely has the skill for a task of this
      kind. But then which poet’s work should be performed?
      219 Padmanābha (“Lotus-Naveled”) Viṣṇu sleeps upon the cosmic waters, reclining upon the
      coils of the serpent Ananta-Śeṣa. From his navel grows a lotus, from which in turn the creator
      god Brahmā appears. This is the form of Viṣṇu worshiped at the Padmanabhaswamy Temple
      in Thiruvananthapuram (see cover image), and similarly at Srirangam, where much the same
      form of the god is known as Ranganatha.
      
      
      
      79
      Stage Manager — (remembering something, happily) Oh! There is a play called
      Pradyumnābhyudaya, composed by the most revered King Ravivarman.
      He is a master of the treatises on music, a veritable Rohaṇa-mountain of the
      jewels of all virtues, a dark rain cloud to the peacocks who are the poets,
      sagacious with the wisdom on poetics, King of the Southern Bhojas, Highest
      Lord over the Mahārājas, who carries the title of “Peerless Battlemettle.”
      Actress — (reverently) Sir! This Lord of the Yadus is gladdened as much by the
      glory of his heroism as by that of Sarasvatī! 220
      Stage Manager — My Lady! You know what they say:
      4
      With his sharp weapon on battlefields
      he has defeated kings, their minds darkened by pride;
      with his sharp intellect in assembly halls
      he has defeated the wise, their minds darkened by pride
      and now this wise son of Jayasiṃha
      roams the earth wherever he likes. 221
      Actress — Well now, if we are to enact the composition of such a king as this, the
      fulfillment of our wishes will be close at hand!
      Stage Manager — (reverently) My Lady! Well said indeed!
      5
      The composer is King of the Yadus: captain upon the ocean of Bharata;
      the play’s hero is Smara, Murāri’s boy, conquerer of the three worlds.
      The assembly is conversant with the dramatic arts such as gesture, and we
      are skilled in theatre —
      and so our good deeds, long since accumulated, now fructify today! 222
      (striding back and forth and looking about joyfully) Oh! How is it that
      spring, the causer of joy for the entire world, has now arrived? 223 For now:
      220 Sarasvatī is the goddess of learning and culture: King Ravivarman is both a decorated warrior
      and man of letters.
      221 As in English, weapons and intellects can be sharp (taikṣṇyabhāj) — the verse toys with the
      two venues in which the king has proven his sharpness: in physical and intellectual conflict.
      222 The play’s author is both a warrior-king of the Yadus, and so is a descendent of Bharata (son of
      Duḥṣanta, see Mahābhārata 1.69.45–50) in the Lunar Lineage; he is also a master of the arts of
      (“captain on the ocean of”) Bharata, author of the Nāṭya Śāstra. The nāyaka or chief protago-
      nist is Pradyumna, the young (kumāra) son of Kṛṣṇa (Murāri). Pradyumna is here called Smara
      (a common name of Kāmadeva, the God of Love), since he is the rebirth of this god.
      223 The question “How ...” (katham) suggests that spring might be arriving out of season — Kṛṣṇa
      is now approaching the stage, bringing vernal splendour in his van and wake.
      
      
      

      6
      In every mango tree, the splendour of the battle-drum is fashioned by the
      cries of cuckoos;
      the victory-bestowing breezes of Candana mountain are armoured and ready
      for battle;
      the trees as well on all sides bear a powerful perfume which is a bundle of
      weapons;
      and so Manobhū, companion of Madhu, strives to conquer the earth. 224
      Actress — (eagerly) Let me try!
      7
      A bee who sings the song of spring gently betakes himself to a mango-
      blossom-garland —
      pretty, freshly bloomed and assembled by the Southern wind.
      Stage Manager — My Lady! Well described! However:
      8
      Now arrived and bearing a certain splendour that causes flowers to bloom —
      how can that Mādhava, the father of Kāma, be described by us? 225
      (from backstage) “Well said!” (voice from backstage recites the verse again “Now
      arrived ...”) 226
      Actress — (listening) Who is this who so approves of your speech, Sir?
      Stage Manager — (looking backstage) My Lady! This is the seer of the gods,
      Nārada, engaged in repeating the virtues of Kṛṣṇa, praising him with my
      own words, since the name Mādhava also means “Spring”. 227 And so the
      two of us must get ready for the task at hand! (they exit)
      224 Kāmadeva (Manobhū, the “Mind-Born” one) is usually accompanied by his wife Rati
      (“Sexual Pleasure”), or else the spring season personified as Vasanta, Mādhava or Madhu
      (the spring month of Caitra). See, for example Kumārasaṃbhava 3.23. The bundle of weapons
      (astrajālaṃ) likely refers to Kāma’s five arrows.
      225 The verse plays upon the phrase kāmasya janako ... mādhavaḥ, a śleṣa meaning both “spring,
      the generator of desire” and “Kṛṣṇa, the father of Kāma[deva, i.e. Pradyumna]”.
      226 A variety of transition types are recognized in dramatic theory for the movement from the Act
      One prastāvanā into its principal scene. In this case (kathodghāta), the sūtradhāra or stage
      manager’s words are repeated by an actor approaching the stage. On this convention, Malini
      (1992: 167) cites Sāhityadarpaṇa 6.35. See also Konow (1920: 26) and Lévi (1890: 138).
      227 Nārada understands the double-meaning in verse 1.8 and recites it in praise to Mādha-
      va-Kṛṣṇa, with whom he is now approaching the stage.
      
      
      
      81
      end of prologue
      (enter Kṛṣṇa and Nārada on seats, with attendants)
      Nārada — Oh, well said! (he recites the verse again “Now arrived ...”)
      Kṛṣṇa — Sir! Enough with this excessive zeal!
      Nārada — O Maker of the Kaustubha Jewel who is Pradyumna! I say enough
      with your inhibitions, Sir. Inability alone hinders my zeal for reciting your
      virtues, Sir. Indeed:
      9
      O Kṛṣṇa! Sir, you are that one upon the lotus seat who emits the entire
      universe;
      thereafter, he with the discus weapon in his hand who protects it;
      then, at the turn of the cosmic age, Rudra who destroys it.
      So who is able to praise your qualities, Sir? 228
      and:
      10
      Dexterity in rending open the sides and chest of Hiraṇyakaśipu;
      an equal cleverness in splitting through the great many necks of the Ten-
      Necked One;
      or the skill, O Hero of the Yādavas, in the playful way you slaughtered
      Kaṃsa —
      speaking of these deeds, my meagre tongue is ashamed. 229
      Kṛṣṇa — Great sage! What are you saying! My heart is abashed by your chain of
      praise-verses, Sir!
      228 Nārada refers to the so-called “Trimūrti” or three deities who create, maintain and destroy
      the universe in every yuga or cosmic cycle. All three are ultimately understood to be forms of
      Viṣṇu here: the creator Brahmā, seated upon a lotus (Padmāsana) growing from the navel of
      Nārāyaṇa-Viṣṇu, Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa bearing in his hand the discus weapon (Cakrapāṇi), and Śiva
      or Rudra, the destroyer of the universe.
      229 Nārada refers first to the Narasiṃha avatāra (referenced above at verse 1.2) who disembow-
      els the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu (e.g. Bhagavata Purāṇa 7.8); secondly to Rāma, who slays
      ten-headed Rāvaṇa, and thirdly to Kṛṣṇa, who as an adolescent killed the evil Kaṃsa in
      Mathurā (Harivaṃśa 75). Nārada contrasts his own inability to praise this god who exhibits
      dākṣya (dexterity), naipuṇa (cleverness) and kauśala (skill) in carrying out these feats.
      
      
      

      Nārada — You have spoken the truth, Sir, since:
      11
      All the four Vedas fail to praise
      the power of your names, deeds and virtues.
      So if such as we should try to describe them
      then well might your heart be abashed!
      Kṛṣṇa — O Great Seer! Why do you speak thusly, without having reflected on your
      own authority, respected by the entire world?
      12
      Thanks to you alone,
      the grandfather takes the foremost place among those blessed with sons,
      for you are the very abode of those qualities found uniquely and universally
      in Sanatkumāra and the other sons he has already. 230
      But enough with that. For what reason have you come?
      Nārada — Most Eminent One, the first reason is to see you, Sir, who are assisting
      in the Horse Sacrifice festivities being carried out by your father Vasudeva.
      Kṛṣṇa — And what is the second?
      Nārada — O thou who art consecrated by the tearing asunder of the demon
      families! This I shall explain.
      Kṛṣṇa — Dear Sir! I am listening!
      Nārada — There is just now a certain demon king named Vajraṇābha, by
      whom the thunderbolt of Ākhaṇḍala was blunted, and whose pride in the
      strength of his arms is unbroken. 231 For a long time, on a ridge of Kanaka
      Mountain, he practiced with intensity ascetic penances which impressed
      the Lord Grandfather. Thereby the demon king has obtained his every
      wish: invincibility to the gods, as well as a city made of every jewel called
      Vajrapura, which cannot be entered by anyone, save that he be given
      permission. And so now, his heart made blind from the madness of these
      two powers, he devastates the three worlds. 232
      230 The “Grandfather” (Brahmā) has several mind-born sons, sometimes said to number four:
      Sanatkumāra, Sānanda, Sanaka, and Sanātana (see, e.g. Bhāgavata Purāṇa 3.12). Kṛṣṇa cred-
      its Nārada with having all the virtues that each of these sons has individually, as well as the
      ones they all share. In earlier mythology Pradyumna is in fact directly identified as the aṃśa
      or partial incarnation of Sanatkumāra (Mahābhārata 1.61.91).
      231 The compound toys with a name of Indra, Ākhaṇḍa, contrasting the failure of his thunder-bolt
      weapon with the unbroken (akhaṇḍa) strength of Vajraṇābha.
      232 The scenario is pervasive throughout all of Hindu mythology: a demon, seeking the conquest
      of the universe, practices ferocious austerities until he is rewarded by Brahmā (“The Grand-
      father”) with a boon or set of boons, which establish a near-perfect invincibility. Once the
      
      
      
      83
      Kṛṣṇa — Seer of the Gods! This has just recently been explained to me by the
      Great Lord Indra, who came and told me how 233 “Vajraṇābha, rendered
      arrogant from the acquisition of boons from the four-faced one, having at a
      certain point assailed Amarāvatī, spoke thusly:
      13
      ‘O Vāsava, give to me supremacy over the world,
      the complete and total world of the great-souled Mahākāśyapas,
      or else you must fight!’
      Having consulted with the blessed Bṛhaspati, I answered back:
      14
      ‘Good Sir, today our father, the sage Kaśyapa, is consecrated for a sacrificial
      rite.
      When it is over, he will do just what is proper.’
      And so Vajraṇābha, having approached that Kaśyapa, was informed by him
      of these events, and was enjoined by Kaśyapa: ‘Son! 234 Just that which has
      been spoken will take place at the end of the sacrificial rite. For now you
      must go back again to your own city.’ And so this abode of the vile governs
      Vajrapura, overtaking the entire world. And so you, Sir, are our highest
      authority!” Right then and there I decided as well upon the destruction of
      that bad-souled hater of the gods!
      Nārada — (with joyful respectfulness) O Slayer of Madhu and Kaiṭabha! It was
      precisely in order to curb the evils such as these that you descended to earth.
      And yet the extent of his majesty is beyond words:
      15
      Whom thirty doe-eyed maidens, captured and taken as wives, worship with
      chowries;
      whom the obsequious protecting deities of the four quarters venerate every
      day with pleasant gifts;
      demon becomes problematic, a loophole is then exploited to defuse and destroy the demon’s
      power without violating the words of Brahmā.
      233 Kṛṣṇa has already heard about the Vajraṇābha problem from Indra directly. Kṛṣṇa reports to
      Nārada what he has been told by Indra (“Vajraṇābha, rendered ... highest authority”, all the
      direct speech of Indra marked in double quotes). This includes Vajraṇābha’s speech to Indra
      (1.13), Indra’s speech back to Vajraṇābha after consulting Bṛhaspati (1.14), and Kaśyapa’s to
      Vajraṇābha (1.14+ ̒ Son! Just that ... own city!̕ ). Note the single quotation marks embedding
      these three inner speech frames.
      234 The gods and demons (Dānavas) are alike all the sons of Kaśyapa.
      
      
      

      whom serpent maidens ever keep from darkness, with the light from the
      gems in their hoods —
      how can that Vajraṇābha, who is here the husband of the Lakṣmī of the three
      worlds, be described?
      and
      16
      In this city of his, the trembling wind wanders about, cooling away the
      sweat of the harem women
      which sits upon their lovely brows, suffering pleasure and pain;
      the many-rayed sun produces light and splendour rich in lotus perfume,
      and the moon shines forth the entire night, its beams densely radiant.
      And so, Sir, please do not delay regarding this urgent matter!
      Kṛṣṇa — Great Seer! We will wait just so long as it takes for my father to complete
      his great Horse Sacrifice. The final sacrificial ablution will take place soon.
      The end of this sacrifice will be the end of the life of that wretched demon!
      17
      O respected Sir, soon shall my dear child Pradyumna,
      having slain this very Vajraṇābha in battle with his arrows,
      douse, with the tears of the shapely women of the demon harem,
      the burning misery of the triple world.
      Nārada — (joyfully) Lord of the World! Well, surely this is no difficulty for the
      destroyer of Śambara, born from your very self, Sir. 235 And this purpose is
      connected with another purpose.
      Kṛṣṇa — How’s that?
      Nārada — Well now, that Dānava Lord has a certain jewel-of-a-daughter named
      Prabhāvatī, of whom the beauty is surpassing, and who enchants the heart of
      everyone.
      18
      Through the gift of a boon was that fair-faced one obtained by her mother,
      in the presence of the Great Goddess of the Mountain — or so they say.
      Kṛṣṇa — Being thusly so hard to obtain, she would surely be precious to her
      mother and father!
      235 The deed for which Pradyumna is best known is the slaying of Śambara (Harivaṃśa 99), a
      demon sorcerer well-known already even in the Ṛgveda (e.g. 1.51.6, 2.19.6, 4.30.14, 6.26.5,
      9.61.2, etc.).
      
      
      
      85
      Nārada — And one time the Great Seer Durvāsas favored her, saying: ‘My dear!
      The man who marries you will walk the paths of righteousness with you,
      and thrive for a very long time. And you as well shall become the mother of
      long-lived sons.’ 236
      Kṛṣṇa — Surely the words of that supreme seer will not be false!
      Nārada — And even as we speak, Prabhāvatī, especially charming on account of
      her blooming youth, has been set up by her father, in accordance with her
      desires, to receive suitors in her self-choice wedding ceremony. But she has
      rejected all of the young men who have come for that purpose as unsuitable
      for her. However, she will certainly fall in love with Pradyumna, who is
      endowed with a beauty that surpasses the whole world, once he has gone to
      this Vajrapura.
      Kṛṣṇa — Surely.
      Nārada — Chief of Dvāravatī! Be pleased to give me now a command to bring
      delight to the assembly of the gods with a great preparation-festival for you,
      for the slaying of Vajraṇābha!
      Kṛṣṇa — Seer of the Gods! Nārada!
      19
      O Lord of the Earth,
      your sweet speech has such virtue
      that my mind, fixed firmly upon it
      can hardly stray therefrom.
      Nārada — I shall accomplish it. (he exits)
      Kṛṣṇa — (meditatively) How then is Vajrapura to be entered, when it is impossible
      to access by anyone and protected by the iron bar of Vajraṇābha’s arm?
      (remembering) There is that actor named Bhadra who possesses powers
      obtained from many boons that were given by the assembly of great seers
      who had been pleased by the cleverness of his dramatic skill on the occasion
      of this Horse Sacrifice of my father. Surely he has the power of flight
      and the power to enter anywhere unobstructed. By this means all can be
      accomplished! (turning towards backstage) Hello! Is someone there?
      236 Durvāsas is a well-known sage of epic literature — cranky and notoriously demanding of the
      women hosts upon whom he imposes himself aggressively, at times cursing them for failing to
      wait upon him with sufficient obsequiousness (or not at all — e.g. Abhijñānaśakuntalam 4.1),
      but elsewhere rewarding young women with boons associated with domestic auspiciousness
      and other conservative feminine virtues (e.g. Kuntī at Mahābhārata 1.104.1–7). See below,
      2.14+.
      
      
      

      (enters)
      Portress — (with a bow) May you propser, your Highness!
      Kṛṣṇa — Vijayavatī! Please summon Bhadranaṭa.
      Portress — As his Highness commands. (exits)
      (then enter Bhadranaṭa, portress showing him the way)
      Bhadranaṭa — Behold, how great is the ripening of my welfare! Since:
      20
      Now will the Blessed Lord Vāsudeva, bringer of peace to the three worlds,
      appear upon the path of my sight —
      he whom even the great sages of surpassing wisdom fail to perceive,
      though they be far above the dust of this world with minds cast beyond it.
      Portress — Sir! Master! Now does this Lord of the triple world await your arrival
      patiently. Please approach quickly, Sir!
      Bhadranaṭa — (approaching with a bow) Victory to the Lord!
      21
      The overlord of Prāgjyotiṣa, his arm knotted up with pride, was an obstacle
      to the worlds’ prosperity —
      But you sent him, revered Sir, to the ancestral city of his forefathers!
      Hearing now of the measure of your valour, being sung by celestial
      musicians,
      The overlord of the gods is nonchalant and asserts his own sovereignty. 237
      Kṛṣṇa — Well, that is not quite how things are now ...
      Bhadranaṭa — Lord! Who then desires to be incinerated by the fire of your rage,
      Sir?
      Kṛṣṇa — This triple world has been seized by a demon named Vajraṇābha, who is
      maddened by the gift of a boon from the Grandfather. I am just now sending
      my dear Pradyumna, together with Gada and Sāmba, to destroy him.
      237 Bhadra references another mythic victory of Kṛṣṇa, namely the defeat of the demon Naraka,
      lord of the Eastern city of Prāgjyotiṣa (Harivaṃśa 91–92), popularly thought to correspond to
      contemporary Assam. Ravivarman sets the events of the Pradyumnābhyudaya in close prox-
      imity to those of the Naraka episode, which conclude with Indra, the overlord of the gods,
      feeling confident and assured in his own restored sovereignty. Bhadra is about to learn of the
      more recent emergence of the Vajraṇābha threat which has robbed Indra of this confidence.
      
      
      
      87
      Bhadranaṭa —
      22
      Against this radiant boy Pradyumna, O Lord of the World,
      how could this Demon of Darkness stand?
      Kṛṣṇa — His city named Vajrapura, fashioned according to the design of Vidhātṛ,
      cannot be entered by anyone, except with his permission. But you will be the
      means by which my dear boy enters it.
      Bhadranaṭa — Lord! What role can I play in securing your good graces?
      Kṛṣṇa — Just so ... (whispers in his ear)
      Bhadranaṭa — Lord! I understand everything!
      (backstage)
      Watchkeeper — Lord, Son of Devakī! May it please you Sir, it is time for midday
      rites!
      23
      Now as the Blessed Lord Sun, beloved of lotuses, performs the rites,
      the bees, distressed by the intense heat, take refuge in the inner petals of the
      lotus.
      The elephants comfort their wives with sprinklings of water from their
      trunks,
      and the temple peacocks shade their sweethearts with their broad
      tail-feathers.
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking up) My, is it noon already? So, now I shall go inside in order
      to arrange farewell blessings upon my dear boy for the victory over
      Vajraṇābha. Bhadranaṭa! You as well must set out in order to accomplish
      what we desire.
      Bhadranaṭa — As the Lord commands!
      24
      Holy men strive to see him with their hearts;
      the Vedas praise his power in their songs.
      You, Sir, are that very one — the inner soul of the world —
      and to be summoned and commanded by you is the very fruit of my
      asceticism.
      (exit all)
      
      
      

      Act Two
      (enter Servant-girl)
      Servant-girl — I have been commanded by the queen: ‘O servant Kālāvatī!
      Go find Master Bhadra, ask him how my dear Prabhāvatī is faring in
      her practice of music and the performing arts, and come back.’ I asked
      him, and he said that he had never seen such cleverness and aptitude for
      learning as Prabhāvatī’s. I am on my way to inform the queen of what he
      said. (reflecting) But the princess, whose virtues are proving themselves in
      this way, is refusing to choose a husband. In fact she dismisses every man
      who has come for her self-choice wedding ceremony. (hopefully) If she
      could find some young man with suitable qualities, then Prajāpati’s skill in
      creation would bear fruit! (looking ahead) Oh, here comes Parabhṛtikā, the
      caretaker of the garden grove.
      (entering)
      Parabhṛtikā — (joyfully) I am now in a favorable position, reporting the joyful
      occasion of the appearance of the first sprouts of the mango tree named
      “Garden Gem,” made to grow by the hand of the queen herself. (looking
      in front) Why look, it’s Kalāvatī who is so dear to Her Highness. I should
      say hello. I’ll go over there. (approaching) Friend Kalāvatī! Where are you
      coming from?
      Kalāvatī — Friend Parabhṛtikā! I am carrying out an order of Her Majesty,
      returning from having heard, directly from Master Bhadra, of Princess
      Prabhāvatī’s skill in music.
      Parabhṛtikā — Why has Bhadra, who has only just recently arrived here, been
      appointed by the King to instruct Prabhāvatī in music, when we have such
      accomplished masters of music standing around already?
      Kalāvatī — But are they all “Blessed-Actors”? 238 This Bhadranaṭa possesses
      a majesty born from his many boons that were given by the sages. He
      wanders, unobstructed, anywhere he likes and has attained the highest
      accomplishments in all of the sixty-four arts.
      Parabhṛtikā — How did a man of such dignity arrive here?
      Kalāvatī — Listen, dear friend! Haṃsa has come into the king’s service as the
      the leader of the acting troops. In the course of his conversations with him,
      the king came to have a great curiosity to see this Bhadranaṭa, of whose
      extraordinary knowledge and skill Haṃsa spoke.
      238 Lit. bhadra-naṭa (“blessed-actor”).
      
      
      
      89
      Parabhṛtikā — Indeed, the king has a great partiality for artists like this. (eagerly)
      And, so?
      Kalāvatī — Then this great actor Bhadra, wandering about as he liked from one
      world-island to the next, happened to come one day to a suburb of the city.
      There, he greatly delighted the demon residents with a performance of a
      play related to the story of the Rāmāyaṇa. So the king, who for a long time
      had been curious about Bhadra, was informed of his presence and Bhadra,
      having been brought along with his people to Vajrapura, and enjoying the
      extraordinary favour bestowed upon him, now instructs the princess in
      music, in accordance with the king’s command.
      Parabhṛtikā — (reverently) Friend! The practice of the sixty-four arts by
      Prabhāvatī, whose charm is already part of her intrinsic nature, is surely
      like the purification in fire of a bar of gold, the polishing of a jewel shard on
      a whetstone, the moistening of a garland of magnolias with sandal water, or
      the moon’s arrival at the autumnal season.
      Kalāvatī — Friend! Well said! Where are you off to now?
      Parabhṛtikā — I am going to report the appearance of the first sprout of the
      Garden Gem tree, raised by the queen as if it were her own child.
      Kalāvatī — Yes, her majesty’s big celebration has now arrived! Let’s go to the
      queen. (they exit)
      end of prologue
      (then enter Prabhāvatī with her friend)
      Prabhāvatī — Friend Kalahaṃsikā! You were appointed to summon Master
      Bhadranaṭa today, why have you come without him?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! I am lost in astonishment and have forgotten to
      summon him.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! What is the cause of this wonder?
      Kalahaṃsikā — In the home of the Master, I saw a portrait of a man the likes of
      whose beauty and charm I have never seen.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! For you to be so lost in astonishment over something — that
      indeed is hard to come by in the three worlds!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Whose heart would not be amazed to behold such an abode of
      unsurpassed beauty and virtue?
      
      
      

      1
      Like the image of Ratipati, 239
      outshining a full moon;
      like the very soul of Eros —
      by whom in the world is that beauty described?
      Prabhāvatī — (expressively) Friend Kalahaṃsikā! These words of yours make me
      terribly curious to see that portrait of beauty. How might the drawing be
      brought here?
      Kalahaṃsikā — (teasingly) If I bring it here, what reward will you give me, dear
      friend?
      Prabhāvatī — Whatever you like, friend!
      Kalahaṃsikā — (jokingly) I will show this by means of my own magic power!
      (concealing, she takes the painting out from inside her jacket and shows it)
      Prabhāvatī — (looks at it; astonished) Friend Kalahaṃsikā! Only occasionally is
      your heart cast over in amazement. Such a beauty as this has never been
      seen or heard of before!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Am I wrong to be so amazed?
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! Now, of what illustrious man might this be the likeness?
      Kalahaṃsikā — This must be a portrait of the Lord Madana.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! Well observed! The companion of Rati, the God of Flower-
      Weapons, looks just like this in portraits.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Just so. That’s what I said — nowhere have I encountered such
      extraordinary beauty.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! How can we find out whose image this is, or by whom it was
      drawn?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! Well, he could be the sweetheart of some woman,
      drawn by her.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! How could this figure be drawn so perfectly by a woman,
      without her heart failing her?
      Kalahaṃsikā — In that case, I think that this must be the work of Master Bhadra,
      who is so skilled in the arts.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! If Bhadra drew his portrait, he must be around here
      somewhere! Or else, he was fashioned by the power of Bhadra’s
      imagination.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! Who could just make up a picture like this? He must
      be around somewhere. The creation of Prajāpati is wondrous indeed!
      Prabhāvatī — Let’s invite Bhadra and ask him.
      239 Kāmadeva, the husband or lord (pati) of Rati (lit. “Sexual Pleasure”).
      
      
      
      91
      Kalahaṃsikā — Yes, let’s!
      Prabhāvatī — (looking backstage) Servant Madanikā!
      (entering)
      Portress — (bowing) May the Princess be pleased to command me.
      Prabhāvatī — Madanikā! Please bring Bhadra here.
      Portress — As the Princess commands. (exits)
      (then enter Bhadra, the way being shown to him by the portress)
      Bhadranaṭa — Behold the tremendous affection of the demon queen for
      Prabhāvatī, for she ceaselessly sends out servants to find out about
      Prabhāvatī’s successes in mastering the musical arts! The quality of
      Prabhāvatī’s wisdom is truly unprecedented.
      2
      No sooner do I give her a lesson on the method for performing
      does she master nearly all of it in the blink of an eye, thanks to her peculiar
      eagerness and adeptness.
      (reflecting to himself) I have accomplished most of what Lord Kṛṣṇa, son of
      Vasudeva, commanded. So far I have brought here the lad Pradyumna,
      in the disguise of an actor, together with his entourage and accompanied
      by Gada and Sāmba. The demon king and people of the city have been
      wholly won over by seeing the performance. Ordered by him, I became
      worthy of Prabhāvatī’s trust while instructing her in the science of
      music. And now an opportunity has arrived for speaking of Pradyumna’s
      excellent qualities:
      3
      I shall speak of the qualities
      of the great-souled Pradyumna
      in such a way that the mind of Prabhāvatī
      fixes firmly upon them.
      And this I carried off well — approaching, as though by complete accident,
      Kalahaṃsikā who was making off with the painting of Pradyumna. She
      would show the painting to Prabhāvatī at some point. And if the daughter
      of the king of demons should see the image of the lad, then our goal is
      accomplished! (looking around, and saying aloud) My! Behold the demon
      king’s palace of unlimited grandeur!
      
      
      

      4
      The outer gate is fashioned from staffs of the bones and tusks of the celestial
      elephants;
      the pleasure garden on the periphery is watered by the tears of the captive
      women of heaven;
      gems, extracted from the hood of the Lord of the underworld, serve as lamps
      in the city’s homes —
      who has the fullness of speech to describe the glory of this Vajrapura?
      The demon emperor’s stout-heartedness is celebrated everywhere:
      5
      Gīrvāṇanātha, enslaved, betakes himself to his house;
      Varuṇa, as water-works supervisor, enjoys the pleasure garden;
      Nidhiparivṛḍha is appointed seal-maker in his treasure-house;
      and Mṛtyu stands at the front of the army, leading his military campaigns. 240
      (wandering about) Madanikā! Show me the path to the Pramada grove!
      Portress — Over here, Sir. (Bhadranaṭa enacts entering)
      Kalahaṃsikā — (seeing this, in a flurry) Master Bhadra has arrived! I’ll conceal
      the portrait. (she does so)
      Bhadranaṭa — (looking before him) Why, here stands the daughter of the demon
      king, deliberating about something with Kalahaṃsikā. I’ll just approach.
      (approaching) My Lady Prabhāvatī! May your wishes come true!
      Kalahaṃsikā — All that my dear friend desires is realized through your kind
      favour, Sir.
      Prabhāvatī — (respectfully) Here is a seat! Please be seated, Sir! (Bhadra sits; she
      looks at the portress) Madanikā! Carry out my command.
      Portress — As the Princess commands. (exits)
      240 The four Vedic deities Indra (indra girvāṇaḥ, Indra “who longs for song” — Jamison and
      Brereton 2014, Ṛgveda 4.32.11, 6.46.10, 8.13.4, etc.), Varuṇa (in later Vedic literature lord
      of rivers and waters), Kubera god of wealth (treasure-lord, nidhi-parivṛḍha) and Yama lord
      of death (mṛtyu) are perhaps as yet only poetically conceived by Bhadra as occupying these
      subordinate positions in Vajraṇābha’s realm, since of course the demon lord has not yet waged
      his total war on heaven.
      
      
      
      93
      Bhadranaṭa —
      6
      It is as though this Pramada garden is imitating you, lovely woman, for:
      it is dark, and you are a young maiden;
      it is beautified by blossomed flowers, as is your smile;
      and it resounds with the confused chattering of cuckoos,
      while you converse on the sixty-four arts with a melodious voice. 241
      Prabhāvatī — (aside) Kalahaṃsikā! How should we ask Master Bhadra about this
      matter of the portrait?
      Kalahaṃsikā — (reflecting) I’ll ask him myself. (openly) Sir! We would like to ask
      you something just now.
      Bhadranaṭa — What is it?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Sir, you roam about all these three worlds. If you have seen some
      man of extraordinary beauty and qualities, who is distinguished in his
      appearance, then could you tell us who that is?
      Bhadranaṭa — (to himself) Now’s the right time for me to say what I want. And
      so: (openly, pointing at Prabhāvatī) Why should I do so, has such a one not
      been seen already?
      (Prabhāvatī enacts bashfulness)
      Kalahaṃsikā — (with exaggeration) Sir, well said! Is there a man who possesses
      such beauty?
      Bhadranaṭa —
      7
      There is in fact a certain young man, who has achieved birth in a family
      esteemed by the triple world.
      By his arm, the world of the enemies is rendered useless.
      He is Anaṅga, whose body is the abode of the essence of beauty,
      whom young women praise upon perceiving. 242
      241 The verse plays principally on the double-meanings of śyāmā (dark / young maiden) and
      the compound kalakaṇṭhakalālāpā (kalakaṇṭha-kala-ālāpā, “having a confused chattering of
      cuckoos” / kalakaṇṭha-kalā-ālāpā, “she having speech concerning the arts that is pleasing in
      tone”), while both Prabhāvatī and the garden grove are kusuma-smita-śobhinī, (“beautified by
      a flower-smile,” in one case literal and the other figurative).
      242 Pradyumna is the rebirth of Kāmadeva, also known as Anaṅga or “Bodiless.” The mythic tra-
      ditions concerning the destruction of Kāma by Śiva’s rage, and his subsequent restoration as an
      invisible god without corporeal form evolved separately from the more particularly Vaiṣṇava
      myths of Pradyumna, who in the legends of Kṛṣṇa’s life is the rebirth of Kāmadeva after his in-
      
      
      

      Prabhāvatī — Is he a god, a demon or a human being?
      Bhadranaṭa —
      8
      Lovely-hipped one! He is a god among gods,
      a demon among demons,
      and a human among humans,
      righteous-souled and strong.
      Kalahaṃsikā — But what world does he ornament? 243
      Bhadranaṭa —
      9
      Presently it is the earth which he decorates
      with his prosperity and fame
      that glitter with sandal, camphor, jasmine and pearl.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Sir, please tell us the origin and the name of this illustrious one.
      Bhadranaṭa — Then listen:
      10
      Invited by the troops of gods, such as the four-faced one and others,
      who are clever and subtle in speaking flattering words,
      Mukunda came to earth in the contrivance of an avatāra.
      Born into the eminent race of Yadu, the pacifier of enemy races now amuses
      himself. 244
      Prabhāvatī — While at my father’s side I heard from the mouth of the Great Seer
      Nārada: “The Blessed Lord, beloved of Śrī, having become the son of
      Vasudeva, governs Dvāravatī.”
      Kalahaṃsikā — And, so?
      cineration. As such there is a certain irony in using the common epithet Anaṅga for Pradyum-
      na, as he is himself the corporeal restoration of the (theretofore anaṅga) God of Love.
      243 She asks which of the three realms — of the gods, humans and demons — the man in question
      “ornaments” with his presence.
      244 The Mahābhārata’s rationale for the descent of the gods to earth is to relieve the earth from
      the burden of overpopulation (Mahābhārata 1.58; 2.33). Harivaṃśa 43–44 expands upon this
      and adds the purpose of the destruction of Kālanemi, born as the evil Kaṃsa. Four-headed
      Brahmā is involved as a kind of administrator of the descent (avataraṇa), at the center of
      which of course is Viṣṇu (Mukunda) who on this occasions takes the avatāra form of Kṛṣṇa,
      born into the Vṛṣṇi clan (the Yādavas or descendants of Yadu, an ancient warrior of the lunar
      lineage) as the son of Vasudeva. Much the same scenario marks the descent of the gods, and
      Viṣṇu as the avatāra Rāma, at Rāmāyaṇa 1.14–16.
      
      
      
      95
      Bhadranaṭa —
      11
      From him who upholds the entire middle region
      was born one noble and praised by the wise —
      a child named Pradyumna —
      like the Pārijāta from the lord of rivers. 245
      Prabhāvatī — (aside, to Kalahaṃsikā) Friend! I have heard about this illustrious
      one being spoken of by the elders of my family in connection with great
      beauty and youth.
      Kalahaṃsikā — (smiling meaningfully) Dear friend! You rejected each and
      every young man who came for your self-choice ceremony, cherishing this
      Pradyumna in your heart!
      (Prabhāvatī looks at her a little angrily)
      Bhadranaṭa — (to himself) It seems as if this Prabhāvatī, whose eyes are like
      wide open lotuses, is in quite a state from hearing of the virtues of the lad
      Pradyumna. Now I’ll really praise his virtues!
      (aloud)
      12
      In all of creation the entire sum of beauty in things moving and unmoving
      does not equal one atomic particle of him.
      If only the creator had not emitted such a splendour, deluding the three
      worlds,
      and then some inferior one thereafter!
      Prabhāvatī — (aside, expectantly) Maybe this is the one in the picture?
      Kalahaṃsikā — (jestingly) He is certainly the one in your heart! 246
      Prabhāvatī — (enacting rage) Get out of here, you joker! Out! I said Pradyumna
      might be the one drawn in the picture!
      Kalahaṃsikā — (aloud) Sir! What is he like?
      245 Bhadra compares the birth of Pradyumna from Viṣṇu, who is said to hold aloft the heavens
      and so make habitable the middle region of space for humankind (e.g. Ṛgveda 1.154.4), to the
      creation of the magical and wish-fulfilling Pārijāta tree from the churning of the ocean (into
      which all rivers flow, hence “patyur nadīnām”; see Viṣṇu Purāṇa 1.9).
      246 Prabhāvatī asks if the lad in question might be the one cittagao (Prak., lit. “gone to the pic-
      ture,”), Sansk. citragataḥ. Kalahaṃsikā puns on the Prak. cittagao and says that he is indeed
      te cittagao, lit. “gone to your heart,” Sansk. te cittagataḥ.
      
      
      

      Bhadranaṭa — How can I describe what he is “like”? For he is one
      13
      in whom the entire class of possible objects to which things are compared
      becomes the subject of comparison —
      he is the very abode of the qualities of virtue and power
      shared by no one else. 247
      Prabhāvatī — (aside to Kalahaṃsikā) Friend Kalahaṃsikā! Ask Master Bhadra
      whether he is comparable to the one in this drawing!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Okay. (aloud) Noble one! Could you compare him to this image?
      (she shows him the drawing).
      Bhadranaṭa — (joyfully, to himself) Thank god, it has all worked out as I planned!
      (openly) This is the very likeness of the lad.
      Prabhāvatī — (joyfully, to herself) O my heart, thank heaven, be glad! For now
      you see the likeness of him whom you desired to see — him whose beauty
      and virtue you have so often heard spoken of! (as before, she looks at the
      picture passionately)
      Kalahaṃsikā — (aside) Dear friend! Our wish has come to fruition!
      Prabhāvatī — Sir! Why did you draw a picture of him?
      Bhadranaṭa — I did so in order to ease my longing in his absence:
      14
      Lo! The eye that beholds such a one as him beholds beauty itself;
      The ear that drinks in the nectar of his voice drinks in the essence of an
      ocean of sensual experience;
      The voice that speaks forth the sum of his virtues reaches the limit of truth;
      The mind that contemplates his substance contemplates the triple world,
      moving and unmoving.
      Prabhāvatī — (to herself) My! Even men cannot endure separation from this one,
      how much less weak women!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Sir! How might this highly dignified one be seen in his natural form?
      Bhadranaṭa — Right now the lad is residing in Dvāravatī.
      Prabhāvatī — (aside) Friend! When this lad is so far off, how can our wish be
      fulfilled?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Friend! Don’t say that. It will be fulfilled, because you were given
      a boon by the great seer Durvāsas: ̒ You will marry a man you love.̕
      247 In the case of Pradyumna, upameya (the subject of comparison) and upamāna (the object of
      comparison) are reversed in a sense: the boy is so beautiful, and possessed of such an exhaus-
      tive totality of virtuous qualities, that it should be with him that the moon, a lotus flower, a
      mountain etc. should be compared.
      
      
      
      97
      Prabhāvatī — (pleading) Friend! Do let that speech of the great sage come true!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Why even ask for this? (openly) Sir! It does pain our hearts that
      this lad of such complete charm lives in a far away place.
      Bhadranaṭa — If you are eager to see him, I will use my wits to bring this boy
      here in only a few days.
      Prabhāvatī — (hopefully, to herself) Oh I do hope that I might meet this majestic
      lad here!
      (entering)
      Portress — (bowing) Princess! He has arrived.
      Prabhāvatī — (quizzically) Who is that then?
      Portress — The queen’s harem-guard, Varadatta. 248
      Prabhāvatī — Madanikā! Bring him in, without delay.
      Portress — As the princess commands. (exits)
      (enters)
      Harem Guard — Victory to you, my lady! Fair Miss, the queen awaits, expecting
      you to assist her with the festival of the appearance of the first flower bud of
      the young mango tree named Udyānaratna, which the queen has cared for
      like a son.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Well then, let us both go straight to the queen.
      Prabhāvatī — (aside) Friend! Hide that drawing in which my heart can take
      comfort, and come along!
      Bhadranaṭa —
      15
      She, who really is this mango tree — for both of them alike are tender
      adolescents
      showing forth their passion in new sprouts,
      will gladden you with a new flower-smile before long. 249
      (exit all)
      end of Act Two
      248 Later (4.33+), Prabhāvatī will refer to him as (Prak.) Varadakkho (Sansk. Varadakṣa).
      249 Bhadra compares Prabhāvatī to the mango tree, as both she and the tree are young (taruṇa);
      while Prabhāvatī’s passion (rāga) is blossoming forth, the tree’s colour (rāga) likewise is
      showing in its new sprout. Prabhāvatī will bring joy to Pradyumna with her smile, as lovely
      as the tree’s flowers.
      
      
      

      Act Three
      (enter Bhadranaṭa)
      Bhadranaṭa ― (happily)
      1
      Hearing of the fabulous beauty of the enemy of Śambara
      and seeing his likeness, the daughter of the Demon King
      is lead by the God of Love to quite a state
      and accomplishes just what I desire.
      Traveling by aerial paths, I have informed the Blessed Lord Kṛṣṇa of
      the events in Vajrapura. Moreover, the lad Pradyumna has heard from
      me of Prabhāvatī’s wealth of good qualities, such as her beauty, and her
      abundant passion towards him, and longs to see her as well immediately.
      (reflectively) Hm, by what strategy shall I lead her into the boy’s line of
      sight? (remembering) In fact, I have been commanded by King Vajraṇābha
      to have some theatrical piece or other performed on the occasion of today’s
      Spring Festival. For this I shall enact the play called Rambhābhisaraṇa,
      composed by the great seer Nārada, and I shall cast the boy Pradyumna in
      the role of Nalakūbara. For my part, I shall be his fool. Manovatī will play
      the role of Rambhā. 250 This will be the strategy for the boy to see Prabhāvatī!
      Moreover, as this daughter of the Demon King is watching Rambhā go
      for her rendezvous with Nalakūbara, her own heart will become fixed on
      meeting Pradyumna. (looking ahead) Well now, here comes Prabhāvatī’s
      friend Kalahaṃsikā. I’ll find out from her about Prabhāvatī’s condition.
      (entering)
      Kalahaṃsikā ― (distressed) Oh when shall my friend’s burning by Madana be
      extinguished!
      Bhadranaṭa ― (approaching) Ho there Kalahaṃsikā! Is your friend well?
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Yes, most respected Sir, if you would be gracious!
      Bhadranaṭa ― You seem upset. What’s the matter?
      250 The play to be performed here is a prekṣaṇaka or short, one-act play, tending to “portray anx-
      iety in time of disaster” (Warder 2009: 144). In the Harivaṃśa source of the Pradyumnābhyu-
      daya, the vidūṣaka or fool is played by Sāmba, Kṛṣṇa’s son by Jāmbavatī. Here, however,
      Bhadranaṭa takes the role of fool ― a casting which “is better than the source’s: the fool is
      almost always the leading actor of a company” (Warder 2004: 885). On this episode of the
      Rāmāyaṇa, see Appendix 1.
      
      
      
      99
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Sir, I am just fed up, since she ― her heart completely under the
      power of Manmatha ever since she saw Pradyumna’s portrait ― is in quite a
      state. Such that
      2
      She shuns the path, redolent with the perfume of the Medlar, that is visited
      by the Southern wind;
      exhausted, she tries to block out the moonlight with outstretched hands;
      desolate-hearted, she somehow whiles away the long night
      and stands, unblinking, gazing only upon that image.
      and moreover:
      3
      With a fire in her heart as it were roused by the touch of the glowing flame
      of Kāma,
      her sighs wither the sprout of the tender leaf that is her lower lip. 251
      Bhadranaṭa ― Surely now are Prabhāvatī’s affections set firmly upon Pradyumna!
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Noble Sir, only your favor can here act as the balm that cools
      the fever of Madana afflicting my friend, whose heart is anxious to see
      Pradyumna.
      Bhadranaṭa ― Come now Kalahaṃsikā, do not despair!
      4
      As the evening reveals the moon, delightful to all people,
      So I will show forth this Pradyumna here,
      and thereby bring joy swiftly to that daughter of the demon overlord,
      as though she were a closed white lily. 252
      Kalahaṃsikā ― (joyfully) May this promise of the nobleman be fruitful!
      Bhadranaṭa ― And where are you off to now, my lady?
      251 The image here is of an internal fire of longing kindled in Prabhāvatī’s breast, which causes
      her exhalations to be hot and dessicating. Consequently her lower lip, likened to a tender leaf
      or sprout, is withered, which suggests a despondent or pouting facial expression.
      252 The Kumuda or white lily opens at night under the moon’s rays. Bhadranaṭa will reveal
      Pradyumna, moon-like in his charm, to the lovesick (baddhabhāvām) Prabhāvatī and so
      bring her joy. The Kumuda flower can also be said to be in a closed or bound-up state (bad-
      dhabhāvām) until the moon’s rays prompt it to unfold. Pradyumna is moreover a hero in the
      Somavaṃśa or Lunar Lineage; the significance of this is signalled elsewhere in the play and
      its source Harivaṃśa App. I 29F.
      
      
      

      Kalahaṃsikā ― Well, I have been sent to find out whether my friend’s father has
      gone to the performance tent to see the play. The king has in fact set out to
      the performance tent ― I am on my way to go tell this to my friend.
      Bhadranaṭa ― Bring Prabhāvatī quickly into the presence of the king. I as well,
      having summoned the actors in costume, shall attend upon the king who is
      eager to see the spectacle. (they exit)
      end of prologue
      (enter Vajraṇābha followed by Haṃsa, Prabhāvatī seconded by Kalahaṃsikā,
      and a ranked entourage)
      Vajraṇābha — (haughtily)
      5
      Were it not for this impediment — the speech of my father,
      who has exerted himself in the offering of a Horse Sacrifice,
      then would I this very day, having slain Śakra and his followers the
      immortal gods,
      give the sacrificial offering to the God of War. 253
      And right now that fool [Indra] is utterly full of himself because of Kṛṣṇa’s
      protection! (contemptfully) And what of this worm of a human [Kṛṣṇa]
      anyway? Ah, but once father Kāśyapa’s great sacrifice is complete, I will do
      just as I desire!
      Haṃsa ― (enacting a “remembering” gesture, despairingly to himself) I, who am
      well-versed in righteousness, have heard from the mouth of Nārada that
      Kṛṣṇa had promised to slay Vajraṇābha, using Pradyumna as his means.
      And yet this Vajraṇābha, maddened by pride in the strength of his arms,
      contemptfully dismisses Kṛṣṇa as worthless. I just have no idea what is
      going to happen here. However, this is Vajraṇābha, after all! (aloud)
      253 In the source Harivaṃśa App. I 29F, two running yajña or ritual ceremonies — Kaśyapa’s
      satra in heaven and Vasudeva’s aśvamedha on earth — set time limits for Vajraṇābha which
      require him to wait before attacking Indra and the gods. The double frame is reproduced
      here, but what above was referred to as Kaśyapa’s satra (1.13+, 1.14+) is now called an aśva-
      medha or Horse Sacrifice by Vajraṇābha. As types of Vedic ritual, satras (having no patron
      and involving only priests — see Heesterman 1962) are of a different type altogether from
      aśvamedhas (royal Horse Sacrifices commissioned by warriors as patron), and so Kaśyapa’s
      satra cannot be an aśvamedha — either Ravivarman or Vajraṇābha have collapsed the two.
      Kaśyapa is the father of demons and gods alike, and so Vajraṇābha refers to him with the
      affectionate tāta. The God of War (āhavadevatā) could refer to Agni or more likely Śiva̕ s son
      Skanda (Warder 2004: 885).

      O Emperor of the demons! Distinguised by your many qualities that like
      swift feet
      overstep the boasting of the demon overlord of the East — who in the world
      could ever stand against you?
      The guardian-elephants of the cardinal points, thinking fearfully of the
      heroic accomplishments of your two arms,
      do not even take up with their trunks the lump of barley cast forth in front of
      them by the elephant-drivers. 254
      Vajraṇābha ― Leader of the itinerant singers! Tell Bhadranaṭa and his people to
      start the show.
      Prabhāvatī ― (aside) Friend Kalahaṃsikā ! Now Master Bhadra will reveal the
      means to the accomplishment of our wish!
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Friend! Thanks to his favor, in just a moment your very wish
      itself will step into your field of vision! 255
      Haṃsa ― (turning towards the backstage and looking) Hey Bhadranaṭa! The
      demon emperor waits impatiently to see the show. Begin!
      (enters) 256
      Sūtradhāra —
      7
      Victory to Madana, to that god, esteemed by the world, the deity of Eros
      by whose power the body of Śambhu came to be joined with the maiden
      daughter of the mountain king! 257
      Haṃsa ― King! It has begun: this was a twelve-term introductory verse! 258
      254 “Demon overlord of the East” (prācīnadaityādhipa) refers possibly to the great demon Nara-
      ka (Bhauma), lord of Prāgjyotiṣa (often identified as Assam), from whom Kṛṣṇa liberated the
      16,000 captive women whom he later married (see Harivaṃśa 91–92).
      255 Kalahaṃsikā uses a common term for “heart’s desire” (Prak. manoraha / Sansk. manoratha),
      but toys with the image of a chariot (raho / ratha) appearing on a road or path of Prabhāvatī’s
      vision (diṭṭhivahaṃ / dṛṣṭipatham).
      256 All text and stage directions constituting the actual garbhāṅka or nested play are italicized.
      257 The verse refers to a popular myth in which Kāmadeva (Madana), the God of Love, awakens
      Śiva (Śambhu) out of his celibate meditation so that he might join together in love with Pār-
      vatī, the daughter of the mountains (see Doniger 1981 [1973]: 141–171).
      258 It is a rule of the Nāṭya Śāstra that a nāndī or opening benedictory verse should have eight
      or twelve inflected words. Here and elsewhere Haṃsa proves himself to be a “sahṛdaya”
      connoisseur of the arts. See Keith 1924: 342–343. In the Bālarāmāyaṇa of Rājaśekhara,
      Rāvaṇa also hears the opening nāndī of a garbhāṅka or nested play and makes much the
      
      
      

      Sūtradhāra ― Your most honoured majesty! I shall perform the play called
      Rambhābhisaraṇa, a composition of the lotus-born divine seer Nārada. And
      so may the king ― the pearl gem in the lineage of Kāśyapa, himself so well-
      versed in Bharata’s science, the highest overlord of Vajrapura ― please
      give his attention.
      Vajraṇābha ― You have our attention!
      Sūtradhāra ―
      8
      O king, overlord of demons! Just as did the impassioned Lakṣmī of the
      Triple World herself approach you,
      here in this play, Rambhā has gone to meet in a tryst the handsome
      Nalakūbara.
      Kalahaṃsikā ― (aside, smiling meaningfully) Friend! This is what women under
      Madana’s power do!
      (Prabhāvatī smiles, her face lowered)
      Sūtradhāra ― (looking all around him) Behold how delightful are the creations of
      the Blessed Lord thousand-rayed Sun! Since:
      9
      Now that the sun god betakes himself to his evening station
      curious to see the play,
      that beam-garlanded one, begging us pardon for his heat
      falls into the Western ocean.
      (by a second person from backstage)
      10
      A multitude of noctural lotus flowers, together with their accompanying
      bees,
      reddened and wearied by the heat of the sun
      await the arrival of the Lady Night and her dazzling moon-smile.
      Sūtradhara ― How shall the sons of Bharata begin? For this is the entrance theme
      of Nalakūbara, accompanied by his fool, awaiting the arrival of Rambhā. 259
      So I too had better get ready to put on another costume! (exits)
      same comment that Haṃsa does here (dvādaśapadeyaṃ pravartitā nāndī tatprastāvayiṣyati,
      Bālarāmāyaṇa 3.11+).
      259 The dhruvā song forms are defined at Nāṭya Śāstra 32.

      prologue
      (then enter Nalakūbara with his fool)
      Nalakūbara [played by Pradyumna] ― (looking around; aside, with joy and
      wonder) Friend Bhadranaṭa!
      11
      Is this Lakṣmī without her lotus? A lunar beam fallen from the moon?
      Is she Rati separated from Madana? Who is this captivating woman? 260
      Fool [played by Bhadra] ― Well now, she really is Rati, and she is joined together
      with you, Sir, who are dwelling in her heart!
      Nalakūbara ― Bhadranaṭa! Is this really that Prabhāvatī, the Queen Swan of the
      lake of my thoughts? 261
      Fool ― Yes, that is indeed her! She is bound upon the root-essence of beauty itself,
      a lamp of auspiciousness in the family of Vajraṇābha.
      Nalakūbara ― (passionately)
      12
      Jealous of the ear which had heard about this beloved one,
      my eye now accomplishes my heart’s desire in seeing her!
      Fool ― Boy! Enough of this fuss, we must begin!
      Nalakūbara ― (enacting a concealing gesture; aloud) Friend Bhadrāṅka! The
      great moment has now arrived for us, hidden amidst this trysting-bower of
      vines of the Caitraratha grove! How is it that my dearest beloved who wears
      the victory garland of heaven, is not here yet? (longingly)
      13
      The venerable breeze of the Caitraratha grove
      stokes the flames of Smara that burn my limbs.
      Oh when will that lovely-hipped one extinguish this fire
      with her embraces that cool like sandalpaste?
      260 Although Pradyumna is Kāmadeva reborn, typically only his wife Māyāvatī is identified as
      Rati reborn (e.g. Harivaṃśa 99.46, Bhāgavata Purāṇa 10.52.7). Neither Harivaṃśa App. I
      29F nor Ravivarman’s play suggest that Prabhāvatī is actually the rebirth of Rati, despite the
      poetic leverage offered by the comparison, deployed here and elsewhere.
      261 The expression toys with the name of a mythic lake on Mount Kailāsa called Mānasa, visited
      by swans; mānasa also means “mental” or pertaining to the heart/mind.
      
      
      

      Prabhāvatī ― (aside) Friend! Blessed indeed is that woman desired by such a lover
      as this!
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Friend! That young man is blessed as well, who meets his lover in
      a tryst!
      Vajraṇābha ― (amazed) Behold master-actor Bhadranaṭa’s skill in dramatic
      gesture!
      14
      The costume! Such enunciation, purport and gesture!
      I feel as if I am seeing the real Nalakūbara before my eyes!
      Haṃsa ― Your Highness, what are you saying? This actor really only reproduces
      for the audience what comes from the power of [the author, Nārada], best of
      sages. 262
      Fool ― Well, never mind this [Rambhā] who has not yet arrived. Cool yourself
      instead by this other who has now arrived: she, the moonlight who bestows
      joy on the entire world!
      Nalakūbara ― Fool! That is not right!
      15
      For I now consider this blazing moonlight to be a stinging, unbearable blow
      upon my tender and wounded body, already burned by separation from her!
      Prabhāvatī ― (to herself) True! Hard to endure indeed is the light of the moon for
      those who pine for their lovers!
      Fool ― (aside, smiling meaningfully) Boy! Isn’t it lucky that what you are supposed
      to act out corresponds perfectly with your inner state — you who are so
      longing for Prabhāvatī!
      Nalakūbara ―Bhadra! No, it is not by chance, but rather by the power of your
      intellect, Sir! 263
      Fool ― Friend! But then how is it that the moon is so pleasant for me, when I am
      separated from my Brahmin wife?
      Nalakūbara ― (smiling) Who in the world is as wise as you, Sir? By whom is
      Rambhā, the life of my heart, delayed?
      Fool ― I suspect that your sweetheart is nearby, but has been seized by some
      goblin or demon or the like while descending from the world of the gods to
      this peak of Mount Kailāsa.
      262 Haṃsa credits the playwright, not the actors, for whatever verisimilitude the play has.
      263 Bhadra remarks that it is lucky (diṣṭyā) that the love-tortured emotional state of the Nal-
      akūbara character matches Pradyumna’s own state of longing for Prabhāvatī. But Pradyumna
      corrects him, observing that this situation has come about not by chance, but by Bhadra’s
      ingenious design.
      
      
      
      105
      Nalakūbara ― (haughtily) Just who among the goblins and demons will seize my
      wife for himself?
      (backstage)
      Lord! Help! Help!
      Vajraṇābha ― (listening, bewildered and enraged) Who is this bowman who
      assaults another person in Vajraṇābha’s presence!
      Haṃsa ― Great King! This is just a play, take it easy! This is Rambhā, on her way
      to a tryst with Nalakūbara, but is being attacked by Rāvaṇa — she is crying
      to her sweetheart for help. What occasion for fear can there be among our
      subjects when you, the chastiser, are present? For indeed:
      16
      O Serpent-Demon of Vajrapurī! Having been ceaselessly protected by your
      arm,
      the people’s desires are fulfilled, they fear nothing and have long been
      content. 264
      (Vajraṇābha stands, embarrassed)
      Nalakūbara ― (with a “listening” gesture, turning and looking quickly backstage)
      17
      Her skin is withered, her limbs flailing about in her rapid approach!
      She is like a forest-pond disturbed by a mad elephant,
      her eyes, like fish, dart about frantically in terror!
      This divine beauty afflicts my heart! 265
      (entering, in confusion)
      264 Haṃsa refers to the protecting power of Vajraṇābha’s bhuja or arm, but also refers to him as the
      bhujaṅga of Vajrapurī, hinting thereby at a sepentine identity. Bhuja also means a serpent’s coil,
      thus the instrumental singular bhujena can be read “by [your] arm” or “by [your] coil”, with the
      image then emerging of a people protected on all sides (paripālita) by an encircling coil.
      265 The verse almost betrays a familiarity with the text of Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.31 (sā vimuktā tato ram-
      bhā bhraṣṭamālyavibhūṣaṇā | gajendrākrīḍamathitā nadīvākulatāṃ gatā ||, see Appendix).
      A woman’s eyes may be compared to fish (e.g. “Mīnākṣī”) as a mark of beauty, but here
      Ravivarman, possibly following up on Vālmīki’s imagery, likens Rambhā to a pond in the
      forest (fem. vanadīrghikā) and her eyes to its fish insofar as they are scattered violently by the
      splashing of a mad elephant: her eyes are casting about frantically in fear after having been
      raped by Rāvaṇa. Meanwhile Nalakūbara’s heart (hṛdaya) can also be likened to the pond
      (hrada) that is aggrieved by this sight.
      
      
      

      Rambhā ― Lord! Help! Help! (she falls at his feet)
      Nalakūbara ― (making her stand up, in haste) Timid Lady! When Nalakūbara is
      here, from what need you be protected?
      Rambhā ― Lord! From this 10-headed one, king of the demons!
      Nalakūbara ― Dear one! What offence has this vile Rāvaṇa caused you?
      Rambhā ― Lord! This evil demon attacked me as I was coming here to you.
      Vajraṇābha ― Hahaha! How fickle is this wicked Ten-Face!
      Fool ― It is said that Rāvaṇa dwells at the foot of Mount Kailāsa, encamped with
      his army.
      Nalakūbara ― (turning and looking backstage, with rage and self-assurance) Hey!
      Hey! Idiot! Stain upon the race of Pulastya! Degenerate demon! Do you
      attack my beloved?!
      18
      Of old was Hara contented
      only by your nine heads, O King of the night-roamers!
      But I shall please him with the food of all ten,
      torn off by my arrows in battle! 266
      Vajraṇābha ― Hoho! What an ego on this son of Kubera!
      Fool ― Friend! Enough of this fuss. This vile Rākṣasa is walking away, as though
      not hearing your speech.
      Nalakūbara ― To be sure one cannot fire upon an enemy whose back is turned.
      But one may certainly curse such a violator of the wives of others! (taking
      up water for the curse) Hey! You! Vile demon!
      19
      If ever you, desiring pleasure, seize any unwilling woman,
      then shall your head split into a hundred pieces and fall to the ground!
      (he casts the water) 267
      Haṃsa ― May this evil-minded one experience the fruit of his own wicked
      conduct!
      (backstage, a shower of flowers and drums sounding)
      266 Nalakūbara references the legend of Rāvaṇa’s sacrificial offering of nine of his own ten heads
      to Śiva (Hara), which are then restored. In Vālmīki’s Rāmāyaṇa, however, the sacrifice is
      rewarded not by Śiva but Brahmā (Rāmāyaṇa 3.30.17; 7.10.10–22).
      267 In the Vālmīki account of this episode (see Appendix 1), Nalakūbara sips (upaspṛśya,
      Rāmāyaṇa 7.26.42) the water in making his ritual curse; here, he casts it (muñcati).
      
      
      
      107
      Fool ― Ho! Friend! These celestial beings rejoice in the curse you have delivered
      upon Rāvaṇa who seized as prisoner another man’s woman!
      Nalakūbara ― Friend Bhadrāṅka!
      20
      Like a plaintain tree whose slender limbs are cast violently about
      by the powerful ten-faced wind of a gale ―
      behold even now this Rambhā!
      What a state she is in, trembling so! 268
      Fool ― Friend! Well then, comfort her, whose heart is filled with fear!
      Nalakūbara ― (embracing Rambhā)
      21
      Oh my timid one, release your fear.
      I, your slave, stand before you!
      The vile flesh-eater is gone!
      Now open your wide eyes.
      Haṃsa ― My king! The play is almost over.
      Rambhā ― (recovering herself) Lord! My poisonous fear is now dissolved by the
      nectar of your words.
      Nalakūbara ― Beloved! What more can I offer you that you might wish?
      Vajraṇābha ― This play doesn’t have much of a plot.
      Rambhā ― Lord! What more could I wish than this!
      Nalakūbara ― Very well then! (final benedictory verse)
      22
      May all good people, together with their kin,
      arriving at felicity, enjoy it for a long time.
      May our overlord of the demons, prospering upon the earth,
      extend forth auspicious wealth to be enjoyed with delight.
      (exit Nalakūbara together with Rambhā and the fool)
      268 Nalakūbara plays upon Rambhā’s name (lit. “plantain tree”), likening her limbs to those of
      the tree when shaken about by a “ten-faced” gale blowing in all ten directions (four cardinal
      points, four intermediary points, above and below). “Ten-face” (daśānana) is of course an
      epithet of the ten-headed Rāvaṇa who has raped Rambhā, who is still trembling in terror.
      
      
      

      Haṃsa ― (to himself) Tsk! Heaven forbid and protect us from this inauspicious
      speech! ‘May the prosperous ones, with their associates, play happily —
      these are the gods! And may Vajraṇābha die and make over his sovereign
      power for the enjoyment of Pradyumna’ — the speech of this degenerate
      actor carries a hidden sinister meaning! God save the king! 269
      Vajraṇābha ― Oh how delightful is the stagecraft of this Bhadranaṭa!
      Prabhāvatī ― (aside) Friend Kalahaṃsikā! How could I meet with that greatly
      blessed [Pradyumna]?
      Kalahaṃsikā ― (smiling) Friend! You must go the way of Rambhā!
      Prabhāvatī ― Friend! How does one get to a tryst without being seen?
      Kalahaṃsikā ― Friend! Do you not recall the speech of Master Bhadra, who said
      that he would show you Pradyumna in the outer garden by a strategy of his
      design?
      Haṃsa ― What the king said is quite true: our hearts were cast into amazement
      by seeing Bhadranaṭa’s production, and so the time has passed totally
      unnoticed! (looking around) Ah! How the loveliness of the evening attains
      her perfection. For now:
      269 Haṃsa recognizes that the bharatavākya or final benedictory verse of the garbhāṅka is a dou-
      ble-edged śleṣa with an overt benedictory and covert sinister meaning, the latter of course be-
      ing the truer sense which expresses the principal plot of the Pradyumnābhyudaya itself. Haṃsa
      sees that santaḥ (“good people”) may well refer to the gods (the enemies of the demons), who
      are encouraged to be victorious in battle: sam+ā+√sad can mean “arrive at” but also “attack in
      battle” or even “recover.” Thus śreyaḥ samāsādya might be read “having arrived at a felicitous
      state” or “having gotten the upper hand (in battle).” The phrase saṃsthāya bhūmau, apparently
      referring to the prospering of the demon king on the earth, might also mean “perish on the
      ground.” Finally Haṃsa, who knows that Kṛṣṇa’s son is an incarnation of Kāma, the God of
      Love, recognizes that the phrase kāma-upabhogyām śriyam ātanotu may be understood as
      “let [the demon king] yield over his prosperity for the enjoyment of Pradyumna.” Following
      Haṃsa’s penetrating gloss, we could then re-render the bharatavākya as:
      May all the devas, together with their kin,
      having gotten the upper hand [over the demons], take delight for a long time.
      May the overlord of the demons, perishing on the ground,
      yield over to us (naḥ, now dative) his prosperity to be enjoyed by Pradyumna.
      Moreover, the roots √ram and upa+√bhuj have distinctly carnal and sexual overtones, while
      their object is conspicuously feminine: the property of śrī (prosperity, wealth, auspiciousness)
      is always construed as a feminine principle, something like a “Lady Luck” figure who may be
      truly “enjoyed” only by one man at a time. Vajraṇābha’s daughter Prabhāvatī is the auspicious
      feminine figure whom Pradyumna will seduce and make his own in the course of his military
      campaign against the demon king, told in the following two acts of the play. This double
      heroism ― involving an emasculating sexual appropriation of a female under the enemy’s
      protection, coupled with the actual violent domination or slaying of the male enemy ― defines
      Pradyumna’s mythic profile in the earlier Purāṇic sources (see Austin 2019).
      
      
      
      23
      All of this, bathed in the waters of lunar light, gleams.
      The moon is a gem; its fragments flow forth everywhere.
      Partaking happily of the sweetest moonbeams,
      the partridges lie down to sleep atop the palace roof.
      Vajraṇābha ― Well then, Haṃsa, we shall retire to our residence.

      Act Four
      (enter a chamberlain)
      Chamberlain (fed up) —
      1
      In the king’s merry gathering I go mute;
      by the counsellors in the assemblies I am deafened;
      in the womens’ quarters I forever pretend to be blind.
      This is how I spend my days. Blast this misery!
      Oh how unbearable is the hot season! For now:
      2
      As soon as he appears, the sun, Lord of Days,
      spits out particles of fire by his rays.
      The world, burned by the heat of summer,
      aches for every single particle of water!
      I have been appointed by the queen as follows: A
      s soon as my dear
      Prabhāvatī, having partaken of the Festival of the God of Love, came back
      from the outer pleasure-grove, she immediately became unwell. Find out
      what kind of state she is in today, and come back.̕ I have seen the lass,
      together with Kalahaṃsikā, by the side of the pond of the Pramada grove.
      She is in quite a state, receiving the attention of her friend who is trying to
      cool her, and withering up from the heat that is fixed in her heart. Indeed
      today:
      3
      The sandal-paste that has been set upon her pitcher-like breasts is dried up
      from the heat;
      her bed made of fresh sprouts is crushed and ruined;
      her garland of fresh lotus-stalks is bleached out from the burning heat;
      and her emaciated body looks like a sliver of a crescent moon.
      And what might be the reason for her sickness?
      
      
      111
      4
      Depression of spirits, betrayed by her long and hot sighs —
      is it really Madana, generating an illness like this
      who afflicts this woman in blooming youth?
      Or is it rather the hot season afflicting her body, so young and delicate by
      nature?
      (gesturing cleverly) The reason for her falling into such a state as this is not
      so much the summer heat, for:
      5
      With eyes closed, as though reflecting on something in her heart,
      giving the impression of one whose cheeks are pale and armoured by
      bristling hair,
      a smile on her face, emitting tears constantly —
      she wears upon her body a different kind of loveliness.
      That’s why I now deduce that she has been beautified by the arrows of
      Madana. And blessed indeed is that young man whom she ceaselessly
      binds to a heart by which the society of all other young men is rejected.
      (wishfully) I dare say, her wish is sure to come true! Moreover, just what
      wish would be hard to obtain by this Prabhāvatī who is so abounding in
      virtues and qualities? So I’ll go to the queen and report on her situation.
      (exits)
      end of prologue
      (enter Prabhāvatī and Kalahaṃsikā)
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! A great service has been rendered us by the Madana-
      festival, where the two of us saw, in the outer garden, that illustrious lad
      whom we had long since seen in the drawing.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend Kalahaṃsikā! That Madana-festival has come about only by
      means of the great festival of beholding the visible Madana, made possible
      by the grace of Master Bhadra! 270
      Kalahaṃsikā — Well said my friend!
      270 For Prabhāvatī, who here outright identifies Pradyumna as Madana (albeit poetically —
      she likely does not yet understand that his true nature really is that of Kāmadeva), the real
      festival is the beholding (darśana) of the boy in the drawing, and this was made possible
      by Bhadranaṭa’s scheming. For her, the public festival celebrating an invisible Madana re-
      ceives all its meaning from her private joy from seeing a manifest or visible Madana, namely
      Pradyumna.
      
      

      Prabhāvatī — Friend! But not everything was exactly perfect, since even Master
      Bhadra, who is a master of all the arts, could fully capture in his drawing a
      man of such beauty.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Yes, yes dear friend! Usually a person’s image is more beautiful
      than the real thing. In his case, it is the other way around!
      Prabhāvatī — Well observed, friend! I am ashamed of myself, longing for a person
      whose character is unknown.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! But we do know his feelings! 271
      Prabhāvatī — What kind?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Such as you have for him, my friend!
      Prabhāvatī — Does wishing make it so?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Well, I call it like I see it:
      6
      When we went to the outer garden at the Madana festival,
      he stood there staring for a long time, his heart overtaken by wonder.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! But whose heart is not astounded by such a Madana festival?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! My lady, surely you must see this yourself!
      Pradyumna was stock still, his entire body decorated by the dense bristling
      hairs arisen upon it, extending out in space like those of a water-lily, with
      furtive glances that betrayed the passion in his heart, with eyebrows like
      great vines that are curved and beaming from an abundance of joy, with
      pupils that languidly moved about under the power of fascination, with rows
      of eyelashes motionless from the Rasa of Wonder. 272 What need of a Madana
      Festival, or indeed of my own words?
      Prabhāvatī — Such appearances are only the result of his natural disposition.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! You have such natural appearances as well!
      Prabhāvatī — Well then who is that woman who causes such longing in him?
      271 Prabhāvatī says that Pradyumna is a person whose bhāva is unknown to her. This can mean
      many things — situation, rank, true state, temperament, but also feelings or sentiments. Kala-
      haṃsikā seizes upon this latter meaning, arguing that Pradyumna is in love with Prabhāvatī,
      and she knows this from the way he acted during the Madana Festival.
      272 The well-known set of aesthetic-affective “flavours” or “essences” (rasa), encoded and rel-
      ished particularly through poetry, music and drama, are typically enumerated as śṛṅgāra,
      vīra, bībhatsa, raudra, hāsya, bhayānaka, karuṇa, and adbhuta (respectively: eros, heroism,
      disgust, rage, humour, terror, pity and wonder). The rasas are said to correspond each with
      a bhāva or affective-emotional state. While vismaya (wonder, surprise) is typically a bhāva,
      corresponding to the adbhuta rasa, the term used here is (Prak.) vihmaarasa (Sansk. visma-
      yarasa). Later (5.11), Pradyumna will be described as being “like Heroic Rasa incarnate” (vīro
      raso mūrta iva).
      
      
      113
      Kalahaṃsikā — Who else but a woman endowed with such beauty as yours could
      ever inspire desire on the part of a man possessing such charm and beauty
      as his?
      Prabhāvatī — He was indeed, even in the meeting of our gazes, marked by a pallor
      and thinness of body, as though he had been pining for a long time.
      Kalahaṃsikā — And indeed, just how long did it take for him, hearing you spoken
      of, to come to long for you in his heart?
      Prabhāvatī — You’re only saying that out of affection for me.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! His state was also made known to me by Master
      Bhadra himself!
      Prabhāvatī — Howso?
      Kalahaṃsikā —
      7
      He does not desire to bathe, nor to anoint himself,
      and being afraid of the moon, he does not linger on the palace roof.
      He does not take any pleasure in music, what more need I say?
      Bearing you in his heart, he despises all else.
      Prabhāvatī — (to herself) O my heart, be comforted! (openly) Friend
      Kalahaṃsikā! Might there be a “Festival of Seeing” this illustrious one once
      again?
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! The two of us will see him very soon, since I was
      told by Master Bhadra that he would lead Pradyumna here to the bower of
      creepers on the bank of the lotus pond.
      Prabhāvatī — (to herself, hopefully) Could it really be that the illustrious one who
      brings my heart to life is coming here?
      (then enter Pradyumna in a state of longing, with Bhadranaṭa)
      Pradyumna — (wistfully, with longing)
      8
      This very day my heart, having no other purpose,
      longs ardently for that means of realization
      which would show to me my beloved —
      like showing to the self-born god the means to subdue the triple world. 273
      273 Ātmayoni, a name of the creator-god Brahmā.
      
      

      Bhadranaṭa — Boy! Your eye completely attained its object when you, dressed in
      the guise of Nalakūbara in the performance tent, beheld for a long time that
      one who is dear to your heart, and moreover the two of you experienced a
      “Great Festival of Mutual Beholding” in the outer grove.
      Pradyumna — You should really say that only I was doing the beholding: 274
      9
      I saw her playing together with her retinue of people in the outer garden,
      amidst the handsome demons who were engaged in the festival.
      Staring at me as though she knew me, her eyes full of affection,
      that lovely-faced one immediately caught my eye.
      Bhadranaṭa — Prabhāvatī is already very well acquainted with you: 275
      10
      She first “beheld” you, Sir, when she heard of your virtues,
      and thereafter saw you in the drawing.
      Now this daughter of the demon overlord
      is constantly fixed upon you, her body tortured by an internal Madana.
      Pradyumna — Bhadra! I as well have her on my mind, and am just barely
      surviving. (making a Madana gesture) Behold, how perverse are the feelings
      of those suffering the pangs of love! For now:
      11
      See how the heat of the moon, falling upon my body, burns like fire!
      The wind, moving about amongst the lotuses, gently touching me, feels like
      a saw.
      The chattering circle of parrots of the pleasure grove is like a spear in my
      ears,
      and likewise the application of sandal paste, alas, is like smearing poison on
      me!
      Bhadranaṭa — These things will return to their proper natures once you have
      united with your beloved.
      274 Pradyumna seems to question Bhadra’s characterization of the garden encounter as one of
      mutual beholding (parasparadarśanamahotsavam anubhavator ubhayor), suggesting in-
      stead in verse 9 that while he saw her, she was surrounded by too many people for the encoun-
      ter to be a truly reciprocal beholding.
      275 Pradyumna has said she looked at him “as though she knew me” (paricitam iva); Bhadra
      protests that she knew him well before ever setting eyes on him, through his own flattering
      descriptions.
      
      
      115
      Pradyumna — Where now might she be, who is the moonbeam to the partridge of
      my eye? 276
      Bhadranaṭa — Prabhāvatī has arrived at the creeper-bower for a meeting taking
      place on the bank of the pond in the pleasure garden, in accordance with my
      direction communicated to her by Kalahaṃsikā. So let’s go!
      Pradyumna — (with longing)
      12
      Nectar in my ear, moonlight upon my eye,
      and life to my mind: thusly do I look upon,
      more than ever, that doe-eyed one.
      I am sunk in a great ocean of joy!
      Bhadranaṭa — Here’s the Pramada grove, let’s go in.
      Pradyumna — (enacting pleasure from the touch)
      13
      Raining from afar sprinklings of mist from the lotus pond
      and agitating gently the lady-bees who are mounted upon a swing of
      creeping vines —
      the breeze at the edge of the Pramada grove is fragrant from comforting my
      beloved.
      Oh how my limbs, tormented by the Bodiless One, embrace it!
      (they enact entering)
      Bhadranaṭa — (pointing ahead) Here stands the daughter of Vajraṇābha
      conversing about something with Kalahaṃsikā. Let’s stop here and
      eavesdrop!
      Pradyumna — Then, let’s stay hidden in the creepers.
      Bhadranaṭa — (smiling) My, how wholly under the power of Madana is the lad:
      14
      He does not understand himself to be hidden by a curtain.
      People whose minds are blinded by passion see nothing at all! 277
      276 The cakora partridge is said to drink the moon’s beams for sustenance.
      277 On this point Warder remarks: “It seems Bhadra meant only that they should stop and lis-
      ten until noticed, not that they should screen themselves and not be able to see properly as
      Pradyumna originally wanted. This is an unfavorable comment on the common dramatic
      convention of eavesdropping. Pradyumna acts shame” (Warder 2004: 888).
      
      

      Pradyumna — (enacting shame, looking joyfully before him)
      15
      She, whose body is emaciated by Madana
      and whose complexion is pale from the multitude of his fulsome arrows
      nourishes the longing of my eye
      like a shard of pearl polished on a whetstone.
      Prabhāvatī — (exasperated) Friend Kalahaṃsikā! If I do not see him right this
      instant, my heart shall split into a thousand pieces!
      Pradyumna — Who is that lucky man for whom she longs?
      Bhadranaṭa — Who else but you, boy?
      Kalahaṃsikā — (joking) Dear friend! If so, you can easily see him in the
      picture. 278
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! What you have said is true:
      16
      Having set upon the brush of my resolve a colour exceedingly delicate,
      I ever gaze upon that one, inscribed by the flower-weaponed God of Love,
      on the surface of the drawing. 279
      Pradyumna — Behold Prabhāvatī’s single-mindedness upon her beloved!
      Bhadranaṭa — Well now, we should rather say “single-mindedness upon her
      Pradyumna”! 280
      Pradyumna — It is only your partiality for me, Sir, that makes you say so. This
      very day you will know this, Sir!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! The truth is, your heart is made of Pradyumna.
      Bhadranaṭa — Boy! Why do you still doubt even now!
      Pradyumna — The ground for my doubt was only the unlikeliness that she, who
      is possessed of such superhuman beauty and excellence, would ever fall in
      love with the likes of me.
      278 As above (2.12+) Kalahaṃsikā puns on the phrase cittagata (Sansk. citragata, lit. “gone to the
      image” or cittagata, lit. “gone to the heart”). The eavesdropping Pradyumna will not catch
      the pun and does not seem to know that Prabhāvatī has a drawing of him. Kalahaṃsikā’s
      comment inspires the following śleṣa verse from Prabhāvatī (4.16).
      279 The śleṣa verse’s second meaning can be read as: Having set upon the brush of my desire a
      passion tender from separation, I ever gaze upon that one, inscribed by the flower-weaponed
      God of Love, on the surface of my heart. Warder offers: “With the brush of my intention,/
      dipped in passion <colour> which is tender <soft> from/separation <distance>,/Pleasure has
      painted him/whom I always see on the tablet of my thought/<painting>” (Warder 2004: 888).
      280 Bhadra makes an alliterative pun, substituting “pradyumnaikatānatā” for Pradyumna’s
      phrase “priyatamaikatānatā”.
      
      
      117
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! My heart has become a quiver for the arrows of Madana, I
      am falling apart!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! My lady, just hang on one more moment. Master
      Bhadra, who has always been entirely devoted to our interests, will fulfill
      your wish presently, having brought that greatly blessed Pradyumna here.
      Pradyumna — Kalahaṃsikā’s speech keeps me from my doubts. (looking in front)
      But a threat to my life has now returned again, look!
      17
      Scattering about with its moonbeams sparks of poison,
      summoning the mighty power of Smara,
      this great peril for those suffering from separation from their loved ones:
      the moon rises forth from the primal mountain.
      Bhadranaṭa — Boy! The moon, your family Guru is, as it were, acting in your best
      interests. 281 For indeed:
      18
      From afar he takes away the darkness obstructing your eye
      as though expressly to make manifest to you the daughter of the demon
      king.
      So as to set a fragrance that is to be carried forth upon the perfumed wind,
      he makes blossom, with the fingertips of his moonbeams, the nocturnal
      lotuses of the long pond.
      Pradyumna — Then he is kind indeed, when there is to be a meeting between me
      and my beloved. For now:
      19
      Suffering a dejection which he assigns to the stain borne upon him,
      yon moon of the dusty-coloured body and pale complexion
      passes beyond, with some difficulty, the day. And now with his colour
      arising,
      the hare-marked one arrives — thank heaven — to bring pleasure to the
      night.
      Bhadranaṭa — Sir, this very day you as well are united with your dear one! 282
      281 As a Vṛṣṇi, Pradyumna is a kṣatriya of the Somavaṃśa or lunar lineage.
      282 Pradyumna’s verse celebrating the union of the moon with the night carries a subtle sexual
      overtone (ramate niśayā), and Bhadra uses a similarly suggestive term (saṃgacchate) for
      Pradyumna’s meeting with Prabhāvatī.
      
      

      Prabhāvatī — Friend! This is my moment, the time to live has come:
      20
      It is the moment bright with white lotuses that are brought to life
      by the glittering glory of moonlight —
      the time when both Pradyumna and the moon alike
      create a burning in me.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Dear friend! Presently shall both Pradyumna and the moon
      become the makers of your bliss!
      Prabhāvatī — How could this come about for me, wretch that I am? (enacting
      excessive ardour and using Sanskrit):
      21
      By nature lovely, cooling and refreshing to the world —
      but do not these moonbeams burn my limbs?
      and:
      22
      The wind is naturally cooling and carrying the pollen of various flowers.
      Is this not yet another wonder, that it should burn me like a forest fire?
      (letting forth a long and hot sigh, and enacting a fainting swoon)
      Kalahaṃsikā — Alas, alas! Such a excess of Madana’s burning has come upon
      her! Friend! Take heart, take heart! (she enacts trying to cool her off)
      Bhadranaṭa — (hastily) Boy! Why do you tarry! Go right now and comfort her by
      showing yourself! For now:
      23
      Behold, the ornament of pearls upon her breasts, bursts open like cooked
      grains;
      her bed that is fashioned out of new sprouts has been burned almost entirely
      to ash.
      The cooling water from the Uśīra plant placed on her heart quickly — dries
      up —
      but the embrace of your arm will suffice to douse her burning.
      Prabhāvatī — (sighing) Friend! Enough with this business of trying to cool me
      down from the burning of Madana.
      Kalahaṃsikā — (exhasperated) What might the remedy be?
      
      
      119
      Prabhāvatī — There is nothing left but death for me, whose hopes are destroyed,
      since Madana now discharges all five of his arrows upon me, who has her
      pining heart set upon this person, so hard to find.
      Pradyumna — (pushing curtain aside and entering quickly)
      24
      My love, I believe this matter of Madana having five arrows is quite wrong!
      For upon my body are falling hundreds and hundreds of them!
      Prabhāvatī — (looking about in a flurry, on the point of standing up)
      Pradyumna — Ah my lovely one! Enough, enough of worrying away your limbs,
      by nature so young and tender, emaciated by unbearable heat!
      Bhadranaṭa — (enacting the pushing aside of the curtain and standing in front)
      Does she fare well, who is seconded by Kalahaṃsikā and who bows so
      gracefully to Pradyumna?
      Kalahaṃsikā — (joyfully) Why, rain from a cloudless sky! Is this the welcome
      arrival of the companion of Master Bhadra, the very heart’s desire of
      Prabhāvatī?
      Pradyumna — Well am I come, if I now see you two ladies!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Please be seated upon this blossom seat.
      (both sit)
      Prabhāvatī — (standing, her face cast down in bashfulness)
      Pradyumna — (tenderly)
      25
      Purchased with your charming virtues, O daughter of the demon,
      behold with your glance, which robs the lotus of its beauty, this, your slave.
      Prabhāvatī — (to herself) How sweet alike are the appearance and speech of this
      illustrious one!
      Kalahaṃsikā — My dear Sir, this Prabhāvatī, unable to bear the momentary
      impediment of a glance, sees you only with her heart! 283
      Bhadranaṭa — Very good Kalahaṃsikā, very good!
      Prabhāvatī — (angrily) Friend, babbler of nonsense! Get out of here!
      283 Pradyumna has asked Prabhāvatī to look upon him as her slave with her glance (dṛṣṭi), but
      Kalahaṃsikā responds that Prabhāvatī cannot wait even the time it takes for her glance to fall
      upon Pradyumna, and beholds him only in her heart or imagination.
      
      

      Bhadranaṭa — (jokingly) Aha, lovely one! Direct your anger rather to your own
      body, my lady!
      26
      With tears of joy and constant bristling of the hairs,
      Your body itself informs us of your hidden inner state.
      Prabhāvatī — Noble Sir, why do you follow Kalahaṃsikā’s example? 284
      Bhadranaṭa —
      27
      As Gaurī to Candracūḍa, as Kamalā to Hari, as Śacī to Puruhūta,
      come and enjoy your husband Pradyumna for a long time, O lovely one! 285
      Prabhāvatī — Sir! Speak that which is fitting for girls of good families who obey
      their elders.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Well now this is precisely your guru, the Master Bhadra, do what
      he says!
      Bhadranaṭa — What I said was perfectly fitting, since:
      28
      Hearts bound to each other in mutual affection
      and alike endowed with the same virtue, lineage and beauty —
      wise men say that for such a couple as this, my dear lass,
      a Gāndharva marriage is perfectly respectable. 286
      Prabhāvatī — (aside to Kalahaṃsikā) Friend! What noble Bhadra has said to us
      cannot be transgressed!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Yes of course! And are not lots of girls married by Gāndharva
      marriages in the Purāṇas we have heard?
      Bhadranaṭa — Hey boy!
      284 Bhadra is also teasing Prabhāvatī with clever words.
      285 Bhadra cites the examples of Pārvartī (Gaurī) approaching Śiva (in whose top-knot of hair,
      cūḍa, rests the moon, candra), Kamalā or Lakṣmī approaching Hari-Viṣṇu (as for example
      evoked at 1.1 above), and Śacī approaching Indra, king of Gods.
      286 According to Brahminical Dharmaśāstra tradition, there are eight forms of marriage, one of
      which is the Gāndharva “love marriage,” initiated only by mutual desire of the couple and
      formally sealed with a prompt consummation (see Jamison 1996, 207–250).
      
      
      121
      29
      For your wedding pavillion, this abode of creepers;
      for the festive sound of the drums, the humming of this family of bees;
      for the celebratory puffed rice, these heaps of flowers cast about everywhere
      by the trees;
      and the fire of Smara as your witness: let the gentleman take the hand of this
      woman!
      (he places the hand of Prabhāvatī onto the hand of Pradyumna)
      Pradyumna — (his joy coming forth) Just as you say, Sir! (taking her hand, enacts
      pleasure from touching it)
      30
      This touch of the long-eyed woman,
      like the application of sandal paste upon all my body,
      now cools my limbs, emaciated by the fire of Madana.
      Prabhāvatī — (to herself) Now my heart, as though sunk in an ocean of elixir, is in
      quite a state!
      Kalahaṃsikā — Good Sir, now you must always hold her in the highest esteem!
      Pradyumna — Why even ask?
      31
      O Kalahaṃsikā, from this day forward,
      what is true is that you must consider me a servant
      of your friend, obtained through her merits alone.
      (both enact joy, beholding each other)
      Bhadranaṭa — (casting a glance) Say, Kalahaṃsikā, let’s both go now in order to
      arrange for the benedictory blessing of this bride and groom.
      Kalahaṃsikā — Quite right. (the two exit)
      Prabhāvatī — How can those two just go, leaving me all alone! (she sets out)
      Pradyumna — What’s the rush?
      32
      O slender-limbed one, this person, for whom the highest good is to wait
      upon you, stands right here in your presence.
      How is it you seek, by leaving, to exhaust your midriff, already wearied by
      carrying the burden of your breasts?
      
      

      (he turns her about by force) 287
      Prabhāvatī — Sir! Why do you deceive me, who am by nature so simple, with
      words that are fit for a clever woman? 288 Just let me go. I am going after my
      friend!
      Pradyumna — (politely)
      33
      O my slender-limbed Lady, run away, rather, from your alarm and remain
      here
      until I have imbibed freely the ambrosial nectar of your lower lip and
      become blessed.
      (saying this, he begins to lift her face)
      (from backstage)
      This way, this way, Sir!̕
      Prabhāvatī — (agitatedly turns towards the backstage and enacts ‘listening’
      gesture) This is Varadakṣa, my mother’s chamberlain, coming this way
      being led by Kalahaṃsikā! Sir, please go hide in the cluster of creepers!
      Pradyumna — (he does so)
      (then enter chamberlain, having the way shown him by Kalahaṃsikā)
      Chamberlain — Good day to you, young lady! Are your pains bearable?
      Kalahaṃsikā — She is now on the mend!
      Chamberlain — Young lady, the queen now desires to see your ladyship, who are
      afflicted bodily with ill-health. Please, let us go.
      Prabhāvatī — Friend! What can I do, I must go see my mother. (standing up and
      making a salutation) Hail, O thou Mādhavī-creeper-pavilion, be for me
      always a healer of my burning. 289 (she exits sorrowfully, accompanied by
      Kalahaṃsikā and the chamberlain)
      287 The preceding verse suggests that he takes her by the waist.
      288 Prabhāvatī’s words are doubly true: she is in fact clever (Prak. viaḍḍha / Sansk. vidagdha)
      enough to understand Pradyumna’s words; she is also burning (Prak. viaḍḍha / Sansk. vidag-
      dha) with passion.
      289 In the hearing of the chamberlain she addresses the creepers, which provide shade from the
      heat of the sun (sandāvaharo); she of course is really speaking to the hidden Pradyumna, who
      removes the burning longing of her desire.
      
      
      123
      Pradyumna — (despairingly) This truth is well spoken indeed, that “the best
      things come with many obstacles”:
      34
      Somehow, thanks to my fate, this door-keeper of the queen
      has become the cause of an obstruction
      just as I was entering into the pleasure of joining with my beloved. 290
      (enacting ̒ thinking̕, longingly)
      35
      Bashfully down-turned, wholly under the power of delight, and with the
      pupil wide open from surprise;
      fashioning a gaze, constituted of blue lotus petals, in all directions;
      pervaded by passion and fixed in my throbbing heart by her watering eye —
      so did her eye appear, squinting with long accumulated affection.
      Well, I will go straight to Bhadranaṭa in order to reunite with her. (he exits)
      end of Act Four
      290 The chamberlain who is supposed to open doors has here obstructed Pradyumna’s entering
      (nir +√viś) into (also, taking delight in) the pleasure of kissing Prabhāvatī.
      
      

      Act Five
      (enter Bhadranaṭa)
      Bhadranaṭa — (thoughtfully) The pleasantness and unpleasantness of the season is
      largely dependent on what one must do. And why is that?
      1
      The time of the rain-clouds brings about pain
      for the demon king who has undertaken the conquest of the world of the
      gods;
      but on the other hand, it has become a bearer of happiness
      for that propagator of the Yadus, who takes delight in his daughter.
      And in the same way, one could say of the lad that:
      2
      Sometimes he, delighting in the fragrant breezes, is gladdened;
      sometimes, comforting the one who, crying incessantly, bestows embraces
      upon him;
      sometimes, examining the excited dancing of the domestic peacocks;
      he happily observes with his beloved a fast through the rainy season, lasting
      what seems like a split-second. 291
      (happily) What we were set to accomplish is now largely complete! And
      all the while, the fructification of youth has come about without a hitch for
      those two, Prabhāvatī and Pradyumna, whose hearts are utterly devoted
      to a mutual passion, and who have met together by every possible means.
      Candravatī and Guṇavatī, the daughters of Sunābha, brother of Vajraṇābha,
      have been united with the lads Gada and Sāmba by Prabhāvatī. 292 There
      remains now only the slaying of Vajraṇābha, the thorn in the heart of the
      triple world. (enacting ̒ remembering̕ ) By Lord Vāsudeva it was promised:
      ‘When Vajraṇābha sets about to conquer heaven, the lad will slay him.
      I shall be present as well. The demon’s preparations must therefore be
      291 The śleṣa verse compares Pradyumna to the rainy season. The second reading, describing the
      season itself, can be rendered:
      Sometimes he, entering into the fragrant breezes, is gladdened;
      sometimes, cooling the rumbling cloud that gives forth sounds all about;
      sometimes, gazing upon the wild dancing of the crests atop the houses;
      he happily casts forth showers, with his beloved, as though in a split-second.
      292 In the epic sources, Gada is not quite a kumāra of Pradyumna and Sāmba’s generation, but
      rather their uncle who is often identified as a younger brother to Kṛṣṇa (e.g. gadāgrajo ...
      mādhavaḥ, Mahābhārata 3.19.17; gadāgrajaḥ ... janārdanaḥ, Mahābhārata 15.5.7, etc.)
      
      
      125
      reported to me.’ The rainy season, now over, presents no further obstacles to
      the demon king’s journeying to the world of immortals, for now:
      3
      Offering pathways where the mud is drying up, its ponds glittering with
      water,
      where elephants are openly in rut — the river can now be crossed without
      effort.
      This autumn season, showing here its own power,
      prompts the war-eager kings to arm themselves.
      (apprehensively) The lad moves about freely together with his assistants,
      desirous of slaying Vajraṇābha who is working for the conquest of the world
      of the gods. And so if he, who is behaving thusly, were at some point to be
      discovered by the demon king, then would a great crisis come about. So, I
      will report to Lord Kṛṣṇa son of Devakī what is happening. (he exits)
      end of prologue
      (then enter Kṛṣṇa and Nārada on sky-chariots)
      Kṛṣṇa — So, then?
      Nārada — Then during the night Vajraṇābha heard from the mouth of the
      guardians of the harem about the boy who was wandering about freely there,
      and so with a mind blinded by rage he went to his residence and instructed
      the army to seize him!
      Kṛṣṇa — And? And?
      Nārada — And then:
      4
      Holding in their hands the terrifying superior weapons of club, spear, axe,
      and mallet,
      the servants of the demon lord came forth, intent on seizing and imprisoning
      your son.
      Kṛṣṇa — (anxiously) And?
      
      

      Nārada — Then:
      5
      Comforting with rapturous words his highly affectionate beloved,
      whose mind was afflicted with apprehension over the destruction of the
      demon,
      he somehow obtained permission from her, and with a sword as his only
      friend,
      the son of Rukmiṇī went out, keen on strolling into battle. 293
      Kṛṣṇa — Alas! Oh, what a scary situation! Then, then?
      Nārada — Then when the battle was underway:
      6
      He cut off the arms of some, resplendent with their bracelets and arm-bands,
      and of others the bull of the Yadus cut off the heads, complete with their
      lovely earrings.
      Kṛṣṇa — Well then, this would give much satisfaction to you who are so keen on
      war! 294
      Nārada — (surprised) Chastiser of Madhu and Kaiṭabha! What do you mean,
      satisfaction̕ ? Then indeed:
      7
      Once the entire battlefield had been made into a bed of arrows
      with gifts of offered flowers and pearls from the split-open elephants,
      night fell and he led a stream of pride-crazed demon armies,
      their bodies crushed by the flying arrows that fell upon them, to a long sleep.
      Kṛṣṇa — Was the demon family wholly destroyed by my dear son?
      Nārada — Right at this moment a total destruction will be carried out. However,
      that army — the enemies of the thirty gods — is completely overcome with
      fear, and one third of it has been destroyed by the lad.
      293 In the Harivaṃśa source, Prabhāvatī fully embraces her new clan identity as a Vṛṣṇi and en-
      courages Pradyumna to go forth and kill her father. Here, she seems to need more convincing
      (kathamapi tadanujñāṃ prāpya), although this could refer to her anxiety over the danger to
      Pradyumna himself.
      294 Nārada is famous in epic and Purāṇic literature for fomenting conflict and taking delight in
      the quarrels of others.
      
      
      127
      Kṛṣṇa — Then, O great sage, let’s go to my dear boy immediately!
      8
      Seeing that earlier destruction of his soldiers,
      the king of demons would armour himself with rage for war.
      Arrogant people striving after their own welfare
      certainly cannot bear defeat brought about by others.
      Nārada — Well judged. (looking before him) Even in a night-battle such as this,
      where one’s line of sight is obstructed by a mass of darkness, the lad is
      removing it in such a way that dawn has broken, thank god! 295 Yes, today:
      9
      A rose-splendoured net in which darkness is trapped by light —
      behold the sun’s halo that has come to the first mountain!
      The discus of the sun, on the battle-ground blood red from the slain demon
      forces,
      promotes joy, just like, O Kṛṣṇa, the discus you carry on your arm.
      (they wander about)
      (from backstage)
      10
      He whose fore-arm is skilled in both the sixty-four arts as well as the
      breaking of the pride of the guardian-elephants of the four quarters,
      by whom that region of the sky, for which the flocks of gods yearn, was
      rapidly overtaken —
      that king, Lord of of Vajrapura, who is about to be satisfied by the
      acquisition of the triple world
      now attempts to make the entire universe empty of the sound of human
      beings.
      Nārada — (facing towards backstage, looking, then pointing in front) It has begun
      just as I had imagined: now this Vajraṇābha, who eats up the ten directions
      as if they were food, rapidly descends onto the field of battle, his body
      well-armed, by means of a chariot of flapping banners that achieves the
      glory of the sky’s jewel — the sun itself — in a momentary flash because
      of the clusters of light from the various weapons carried in the palm of his
      hand. He looks as though he will incinerate the entire living world with his
      295 Pradyumna’s name (lit., “pronounced majesty,” or “fore-splendour”) is suggestive of great
      luminosity. His defeat of the demon king is naturally coordinated with the dawning of day.
      
      

      cutting glances, harsh with the fire of his rage, while his own authority is
      proclaimed by army generals whose mouths are resonant with flattering
      words, and who have approached with arrogant boasting.
      Kṛṣṇa — (with great respect) Blessed Sir, this is a worthy target for my dear boy!
      Nārada — Certainly. But I think it unfair for this lad on foot to fight with
      Vajraṇābha, mounted on his chariot!
      Kṛṣṇa — Great seer! The chariot of my dear boy is equipped with the King of
      Snakes as its charioteer, and it goes wherever he wishes! 296 (pointing
      forwards) Look! Even now is my dear boy:
      11
      With his bow, its string drawn and set upon his carrying-shoulder,
      and having bound upon his back a pair of quivers,
      he mounts upon the chariot of fluttering banners:
      he is the Heroic Rasa incarnate before our eyes.
      Nārada — (looking joyfully) Right at this moment the lad, by slaying the demon
      king, will bring before my eyes everything they long to see:
      12
      This sound from the battlefield — the twanging of the bowstring
      of this Yādava king, enemy of Śambara,
      wishes to inform the anxious triple-world:
      “This very day he will lead the Demon king to his destruction!”
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking all around)
      13
      In chariots with nets of bells that are sounding forth from rubbing against
      one another,
      and set with banners, their edges fluttering about in the wind —
      in their eagerness to witness forthwith the wondrous battle between my dear
      boy and the Lord of demons,
      the car-going celestials pack full the firmament from here to there.
      296 Of this line Warder says that “Kṛṣṇa describes him mounting an imagined chariot with a drag-
      on king as a charioteer” (2004: 889). Kṛṣṇa is in fact referring to the cosmic serpent Anan-
      ta-Śeṣa, who is clearly identified as the chariot’s driver in the Harivaṃśa source, and who is
      not imaginary: sahasraśirasaṃ nāgaṃ kṛtvā sārathim ātmavān | anantabhogaṃ kauravya
      sarvanāgottamottamam || Harivaṃśa App. I 29F lines 699–700.
      
      
      129
      Nārada — (reflecting) How have the lad and Vajraṇābha begun their fight? Now:
      14
      The demon’s arrows, which cause the triad of earth, intermediate space and
      heaven to be overcome with fear of the destruction of propriety
      are released by that lord of the enemies of the gods, his bow drawn out
      fiercely.
      From them particles of fire explode forth mid-flight, but immediately
      they are pulverized by this hero, grandson of Ānakadundubhi, by his own
      razor-sharp arrows. 297
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking in front) Ah, how firm are the limbs of the demon king! Since:
      15
      On this chest of the King of Vajrapura,
      marked by the scarred-over sores from the lightning-bolt of Indra,
      the arrows cast forth by my dear boy
      are futile, like instructions given to a fool.
      Nārada — (joyfully) O slayer of Kaṃsa, behold the heroic strength of your son’s
      arm, so prized by the entire world!
      16
      Upon the chest of the demon king — where the power of the weapons of
      gods and demons alike is blunted —
      upon this chest broad as the plateau of Gotra mountain, broad enough to
      serve as a courtyard in the pleasure ground of the Lakṣmī of the world,
      is spread a self-created ruin by these arrows — a stream fit to be harnessed
      for splitting apart the mass of the arm of the raving mad Śambara —
      discharged by Pradyumna.
      Kṛṣṇa — (pointing in front) Blessed Sir! Bhagavan! Meanwhile who is this, like
      rage incarnate, with his bow drawn up to his ear, making the mid-region of
      the sky resound with the noise of his chariot, rushing impetuously forward?
      Nārada — (distinctly, with gravity and amazement)
      297 Kṛṣṇa’s father Vasudeva is also known as Ānakadundubhi.
      
      

      17
      Superior in might and in the power of his arm, this younger hero
      is named Sunābha, the brother of the demon master by whom the world is
      agitated.
      Once fallen in battle upon his chest, the staff of the Lord of Ghosts becomes
      a mere twig of a castor tree,
      and the thunderbolt of Indra, enemy of Jambhāsura, turns into a lotus-stalk.
      Kṛṣṇa — (agitatedly) But it should not happen, that while this battle between
      Vajraṇābha and Pradyumna is taking place, that this Sunābha should
      provide assistance! Yet he is approaching Vajraṇābha! So then, I as well
      shall go stand by my dear son.
      Nārada — (joyfully) Sir, relax!
      18
      Standing firm, as if against a great mountain cast by the lightning-bolt-
      wielding Indra,
      upon a chariot making a joyful sound with its own pig-squeals,
      like a lion of celebrated valour against an elephant,
      your younger brother Gada counter-matches the unchecked Sunābha.
      Kṛṣṇa — (boastfully) Blessed Sir, my dear brother does what the situation calls for!
      Nārada — (reverently)
      19
      Why this amazement, O Kṛṣṇa, of the resolute Gada?
      Such battle-timing as this belongs to the kings born into the Yadu
      lineage!
      Kṛṣṇa — (impetuously) Blessed Sir! While this battle of pairs continues between
      my dear son and brother against Vajraṇābha and Sunābha, alas the soldiers
      of the army of the enemies of the thirty gods, who are vehement in their
      battle-pride, are attacking Sāmba!
      Nārada — (describing joyfully) Don’t be agitated. Look, look!
      20
      Sāmba mounts the elephant Airāvata, brought hither by Indra —
      an elephant whose ten forms of attack can be equalled by no other — and
      assails the war-ready demon soldiers.298
      298 “Whose ten forms of attack can be equalled by no other:” ananyasāmānyadaśaprahāram.
      Here the TSS editor Śāstrī adds in a helpful note: [Airāvata] is skilled in attacks that amount
      to ten forms, as opposed to any other elephant. The fact that he has ten is because of his two
      
      
      131
      Kṛṣṇa — Ah, behold how great is Indra’s favour to us!
      Nārada — You should rather say that it is a favour to himself. 299 (enacts listening)
      What did Vajraṇābha, completely under the power of wrath, rage and
      fury, say? — ‘Hey, hey you! Ignorant human whelp! You do not know
      Vajraṇābha!
      21
      My arrows are checks against the arising of the rutting sap in the
      circumference of the crazed Airāvaṇa’s temple;
      they bring forth teardrops into the eyes of the harem women of the
      protectors of the heavenly quarters.
      Excessively thirsty from the long absence of a worthy target, I make with
      them this very day
      an invigorating warrior’s-drink on your chest which offers an intoxicating
      liquor of oozing blood!’
      Kṛṣṇa — Behold the arrogance of this wretched demon!
      Nārada — (enacting listening) But what does the lad say, whose lotus face is sweet
      from its gentle smile? ‘Hey you vile demon! Why all this boasting!
      22
      With my arrows that are scattering sparks of fire, I shall spill on the earth
      your blood, violently spilling out of your gaping maw, terrible with its
      innumerable fangs.
      Seeing you thus this very day, the thousand eyes of the surprised Indra,
      enemy of Vṛtra,
      bright with tears of joy, will achieve the highest satisfaction.’
      (boastfully) Today the lad brings satisfaction to my eyes and ears which
      alike have thirsted for so long!
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking about everywhere) Great Seer! A weapon of darkness has
      now been deployed by the demon king who is fond of fighting with divine
      weapons! Since:
      extra tusks. It is said in the Mātaṅgalīlā that, for any other elephant [except Airāvata], eight
      forms of attack are spoken of, namely the trunk, tail, tusks and four feet. From this, therefore
      are [other] elephants “eight-weaponed” (aṣṭapraharaṇa).
      299 Nārada suggests that in the end all of this trouble is meant to save Indra from being conquered
      by Vajraṇābha.
      
      

      23
      Unexpectedly creating a state of eclipse of that overlord of days, the sun,
      and causing happiness for the Apsarases who may now roam at will,
      hastening to rendez-vous with their heroes,
      a net of darkness — black as the poison in the throat of the husband of
      Mṛḍānī and fit to be cut with a blade —
      advances, confining the mid-region of space and seizing the vital power of
      the eyes of humankind. 300
      Nārada — (looking about joyfully) But the lad, skilled in countermeasures,
      discharges a divine fire arrow!
      24
      Thanks to the circles of fiery splendour by means of which the arisen
      darkness is defeated,
      it is from here possible for you to perceive, O Lord of the Yadu family, with
      a glance of the eye,
      an exceedingly great wonder in the sky: these autumnal clouds
      shining forth like rain-clouds, with their creeping lightning-streak
      companions.
      Kṛṣṇa — (gesturing) Oh no! Does the evil demon now take up a water-arrow as a
      counter-weapon? For now:
      25
      Endowed with a dark radiance that surpasses that of a mountain of black
      collyrium being shaken, cast upwards, and pulled up by the roots by the
      churning of the burning hot wind that spreads at the end of a kalpa,
      some rows of rainclouds now deafen everything
      with roars that are as powerful as the rumbling of the ocean being churned
      by the cosmic churning-mountain.
      Nārada — (joyfully, in wonder) Kṛṣṇa! Behold, Sir, how the boy now summons a
      wind-weapon, since:
      300 Śiva, husband of Mṛḍānī (Pārvatī) saves the world by consuming poison, on account of which
      his neck becomes blue (Nīlakaṇṭḥa). Now begins a series of māyic or illusory weapon vol-
      leys launched by Vajraṇābha and countered by Pradyumna: darkness (5.23), fire (5.24), water
      (5.25), wind (5.26), snakes (5.27) countered by Garuḍa (5.28, 29), and a mace (5.30) countered
      by the cakra (5.31, 32, 33).
      
      
      133
      26
      By violent winds that are determined to bring about the apocalyptic
      Saṃvarta cloud, and which, like the Saṃvarta, are endowed with a
      tumultuous noise born from an impetuosity of movement,
      the masses of clouds at once are dispersed across the sky, as easily as if they
      were a bundle of grass.
      Kṛṣṇa — (despairing) Now that evil-minded wretched demon has deployed a
      divine snake weapon. Indeed:
      27
      By means of the clusters of light from the jewels on their hoods,
      like a forest of coral in the ocean of the sky —
      behold! — everywhere now the snake-kings by the hundreds
      produce an untimely dawn.
      Nārada — (joyfully) Right at that spot is a divine snake-eating arrow set upon the
      bow by the destroyer of Śambara!
      28
      Behold now this sky!
      Many Tārkṣya eagles — your vehicles, O slayer of Madhu —
      almost like mountains of moving gold,
      wildly come to him.
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking, with delight)
      29
      Terrified by the winds arising from the multitude of flapping wings of the
      roaming Garuḍas,
      the snakes flee in all directions, in various ways.
      Nārada — (taking heed, fearfully) Damn this pernicious turn of events: for now
      that the various divine weapons have been rendered impotent by the boy
      who has such dexterity in the use of counter-weapons, Vajraṇābha’s rage has
      now doubled and he violently takes up a mace, given by Brahmā and whose
      great value was proven in the war of the gods and demons, and haughtily
      brandishes it about vigorously!
      Kṛṣṇa — (anxiously) Alas! My heart is bewildered as to what will happen here!
      Nārada — (despairingly)
      
      

      30
      Barely visible because of the halos of light and splendrous burning,
      thrumming with the fierce sound of bells like the rumbling of thunderclouds
      at the end of time,
      this mace is cast forth by the demon king
      against the lad as he attacks, as fiercely as though he were fighting with a
      hundred arrows.
      Kṛṣṇa — (despairing) Great seer! Just as I feared, now my dear boy, his limbs
      afflicted by the mace assault, his lotus-eyes closed in a swoon, now
      stops altogether and leans for support on the staff of his bow. I will go to
      invigorate him. (makes to go forth)
      Nārada — Don’t worry -- look, look!
      31
      This boy recovers himself
      and is composed once again — an ocean of fortitude! —
      he desires to kill the demon king inflated with pride
      and so meditates upon the perfect weapon of Sudarśana. 301
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking, relieved) Seer of the Gods! Well spotted by you Sir, since:
      32
      Forthwith the troops of gods, agitated by the fear that they will be burned,
      clear themselves off from its path a long distance away;
      lapping repeatedly with its flames the chowrie plumes of the horses of the
      sun,
      it is seen by the elephant-kings of the celestial quarters whose minds, even
      from afar, are defiled by the fear that the end of the world has come:
      in the sky appears the cakra king, whose path is fashioned from the
      slaughtering of enemies.
      Nārada — (looking, joyfully)
      33
      The cakra, as though resplendent with a mighty fire,
      is discharged by the enemy of Śambara
      and falls — aha! — upon the demon overlord,
      together with the gazes of the gods.
      301 Kṛṣṇa’s characteristic weapon, the cakra or deadly discus blade, is known as Sudarśana and
      is often anthropomorphized and depicted as a subordinate deity attending Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa.
      
      
      135
      Kṛṣṇa — (with joy and wonder) Seer of the Gods! Now has been accomplished that
      which we desired, for now this one:
      34
      Who had been beheld fearfully by the multitudes of gods,
      whose blood is now being spit forth from his split open joints, weak spots
      and heart by the blades of the cakra —
      Vajraṇābha, the relative of the demons whose play is a threat to the triple
      world,
      lays to rest his final battle upon a warrior’s bed.
      Nārada — (bewildered) Come over here, you must see this!
      35
      Its lower lip bitten by its fangs, its forehead twisted into a frown as cruel as
      the trident held aloft in the hand of Tripurahara;
      the corners of its harsh eyes fixed upon the face of his enemy:
      cut off and tossed aloft by Gada with his heron-feather arrows that vomit
      forth flames of sparkling fire,
      the head of Sunābha will presently fall, spreading joy to the eyes of the
      gods.
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking, happily smiling) Proper indeed, the younger brother’s following
      his elder’s example!
      Nārada — (pointing elsewhere) Look, the army as well is following the path taken
      by their master. For indeed:
      36
      This great army sent forth by the unmoving demon lord is ruined
      when the submarine fire of Sāmba appears, blazing in the midst of the ocean
      of battle.
      Kṛṣṇa — (joyfully) Great seer! Looking upon my dear boy — the conqueror of
      Vajraṇābha, who was endowed with the might of an arm unconquered by
      any god or demon, together with his followers — accompanied by Gada and
      Sāmba, I now know myself to be one who has attained his purpose.
      Nārada — And now as well have all the worlds attained their purpose! (looking
      around, with joy and reverence):
      
      

      37
      Beholding Vajrapurī, where the enemy of the gods has been destroyed
      by the flow of frightful weapons cast by the lad in battle,
      I recall now Laṅkā, with its army of the ten-headed one destroyed
      by the multitudes of your arrows, O Kṛṣṇa, who are the soul of Rāma!
      Kṛṣṇa — Blessed Sir, Nārada! You, Sir, are indeed a witness to all battles!
      Nārada — Now do the gods, headed by Mahendra with their minds given over
      utterly to joy, applaud Pradyumna, who is self-chosen by the Śrī of victory.
      For now:
      38
      His head cut off and cast down, almost resembling a mountain bereft of its
      peak,
      a thorn in the side of the world lying upon the battlefield —
      as soon as yon ageless gods see the lord of the demons
      a shower of flowers immediately falls, cast from their hands.
      Kṛṣṇa — Great Seer! We as well shall approach and welcome my dear son, the
      vanquisher of Vajraṇābha.
      Nārada — Let’s do it.
      (both enact getting down from their chariots)
      Nārada — (pointing in front) Lord, son of Devakī! Now
      39
      Pradyumna places himself before you, together with Gada and Sāmba,
      like fortitude incarnate, being waited upon by artha and dharma. 302
      (then enter Pradyumna, as indicated)
      Pradyumna — Dear Father, Gada, my dear Sāmba! Today we have surpassed all
      our wishes that we would see the feet of our dear ones after a long time!
      302 Pradyumna is likened to utsāha (fortitude) incarnate, being waited upon by artha and dhar-
      ma; but of course he is also kāma incarnate in a far more literal way, and so is grouped here
      with artha and dharma which constitute the three arthas or goals of the householder.
      
      
      137
      40
      Carrying upon our heads the command — only ever easy to carry out — of
      those dear ones as though it were the ritual offering leftovers from the
      temple
      we left Dvāravatī and came to this demon city through various strategies.
      Thanks to our guru Bhadra, who has mastered all wisdom, we met and wed
      the demon’s daughters,
      and having slain in battle Vajraṇābha, together with his army, we now bring
      delight to the triple world.
      Gada — Dear Pradyumna and Sāmba! Here comes our noble father with the seer of
      the gods, Nārada.
      Sāmba — Well, we as well must go meet them quickly!
      (thus all of them, having approached, enact a salutation to Kṛṣṇa)
      Kṛṣṇa — (making them all stand up, he hugs them; joyfully and reverently) Thank
      god! Now I see my victorious dear ones here, their bodies unharmed! Dear
      ones! Please greet this seer of the gods Nārada!
      (they all do so)
      Nārada — O Pradyumna, who art the submarine fire in the great ocean of
      Vajraṇābha! O Gada, who art a lion against the elephant cub that is
      Sunābha! O Sāmba, who art the burning fire destroying the army of the
      demon king! Be ye ever more long lived!
      (entering, pushing aside the stage curtain)
      Bhadranaṭa — (bowing) Lord! Thank god you are well!
      41
      The dear beloved wives, Prabhāvatī, Candravatī and Guṇavatī
      have given birth to the family-propogating sons of Pradyumna, Gada and
      Sāmba!
      (they all enact joy)
      Nārada — It is true what they say — ‘Success begets success!’
      Kṛṣṇa — Great seer! The Yādava family is now sure to prosper.
      Nārada — Lord of the World! In fact we should say that the whole world is sure to
      prosper!
      
      

      Kṛṣṇa —
      42
      In the full bloom of young adulthood, knowers of weapons, fully
      accomplished in the sciences,
      the long-lived lads have become protectors of the world.
      Nārada — Just so indeed.
      Pradyumna, Gada and Sāmba — You are very kind.
      Kṛṣṇa — Good Sir, I desire to consecrate my dear Pradyumna, the conqueror of
      Vajraṇābha, here in Vajrapura.
      Nārada — The whole world desires this, which you speak of, Sir. So why wait any
      longer?
      43
      Contented by the defeat of the enemy,
      you must make the boy a universal sovereign.
      There is joy for a great many people in the world
      when a fruit reaches its fullness.
      Kṛṣṇa — Ho, Bhadranaṭa! Let the necessities for the consecration be prepared!
      Bhadranaṭa — Lord! They have already been prepared! The elements for the
      consecration have been sent by the god Mahendra, and this Vajrapurī is
      now ornamented:
      44
      With its banners dancing upon the palace wrapped in silk,
      lofty archways, perfumes of delicate incense being burned,
      and lovely from the auspicious rows of lamps that have been placed between
      the courtyard gateways —
      behold the residence of the demon king!
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking, joyfully) Then please bring quickly all of the items for the
      consecration!
      Bhadranaṭa — As the Lord commands. (he leaves and comes back again) Lord! It
      has all been brought here!
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking at Pradyumna) Dear boy! Please sit upon this well-decked royal
      throne!
      Pradyumna — (modestly) As you wish, father. (saying this, making a salutation,
      he sits down, facing forwards)
      (Kṛṣṇa consecrates him with a gesture. Immediately from behind stage,
      a cascade of flowers)
      
      
      139
      45
      Whose initiation bound him to a great vow to suppress evildoers,
      whose rod of law is his arm ever-ready to protect the triple world —
      may the Lord of the Yadu kings keep the throne that marks universal
      sovereignty
      for a thousand autumns!
      Nārada — Kṛṣṇa! Now do the gods hail the Mahārāja Pradyumna, whose
      consecration as universal emperor you have performed, Sir!
      Kṛṣṇa — Great seer Nārada! What have we now remaining to accomplish here?
      Nārada — (joyfully and eulogistically)
      46
      The triple world has been brought to a state of joy by the destroyer of the
      overlord of the demons;
      like Vajraṇābha’s daughter, the splendour of universal sovereignty has been
      brought under his power through his supreme virtue;
      thanks to the glory of the consecration that has been fulfilled, the tree of
      dharma abundantly flowers —
      all because, O Lord of the Yādavas, everything has been accomplished for
      us by Pradyumna!
      Kṛṣṇa — (looking at Pradyumna) Dear boy! What more that you might wish can I
      offer to you?
      Pradyumna — Father! Is there anything beyond this I could desire? This very day,
      through your grace Sir, and by me as well
      47
      The demon king is slain in battle along with each and every one of his
      kinsmen,
      and his entire kingdom of lavish wealth has been acquired without
      remainder.
      Likewise has every living thing been settled again, the anxieties of their
      hearts pacified.
      What more need we say? Everything we had desired has been achieved!
      
      

      (the concluding benedictory verse) And so let this be just so:
      48
      As oceans do with their hundreds of gems, may good men spread joy with
      their praises;
      may evil people, who have descended into the great sins of the world like
      blunders of the Kali age be destroyed;
      may donors, like rain clouds, rain down the wealth we desire in accordance
      with good practice,
      and may the kings, like the major mountain ranges, tirelessly support the
      earth.

      Ravivarman does not invent the Act Three garbhāṅka or nested play, but expands
      it from his HV App. I 29F source (see Introduction). The Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa 7.26
      likely constitutes the oldest extant source of the episode. In this section of the epic,
      Rāvaṇa’s life prior to the events of the Rāmāyaṇa are recounted, particularly his
      violent campaign of sexual aggression, of which his rape of Rambhā is one example.
1. Then heroic Ten-Necked [Rāvaṇa], together with his army, chose a place to settle
   down once the sun set.
   2–3. There, once the spotless moon, radiant as a mountain, had arisen, he saw the
   lovely virtues of that place, beautified by the moon’s rays, by its groves of divine
   Karṇikā trees, and likewise by its thickets of Kadambas, opened lotuses, and by the
   waters of the Mandākinī river as well.
4. A sweet sound was heard, like the ringing of bells sounding forth among the as-
   semblies of Apsarases in the home of Kubera.
5. It was as though the mountains, perfumed by sweet Mādhava, struck by the wind
   and so sending forth cascades of flowers, were receiving that hill as a guest.
6. The pleasant breeze blew, carrying forth a rich perfume mingled with the pollen of
   sweet flowers, and augmented Rāvaṇa’s desire.
   7–8. Because of the song, the abundance of flowers, the cool breeze, the mountain’s
   beauties, and the rising of the moon, as the night passed greatly heroic Rāvaṇa, fal-
   len under the sway of Kāma’s arrows, sighed again and again and contemplated the
   moon.
   9–11. At that moment Rāvaṇa perceived Rambhā walking amidst his soldiers: the
   loveliest of all Apsarases, she had a face like the full moon, ornamented by divine
   flowers. She was covered with fresh markings made from flower-festivals of all six
   seasons, [and was wearing] a dark blue garment with the sheen of a rain-cloud. Her
   
   
   Appendix 1
   face resembled the moon, her lovely eyebrows arched bows; her thighs were like
   elephant-trunks and her hands were tender blossoms.
12. Standing up, the king of demons, tormented by Kāma’s arrows, took her hand as
    she passed by and, smiling, said to her:
13. “Where are you going, fair-hipped one? What bliss do you yourself partake of?
    To whom belongs this happy moment — who is this man who will take pleasure upon
    you (tvāṃ samupabhokṣyate)?
14. “Who is he who today will attain the pleasure of the sap of elixir that is the sap of
    your mouth, perfumed by blossomed flowers?
15. “Upon whose chest will you bestow the touch of these lovely fleshy and firm
    breasts of yours, like golden pots, O timid one?
16. “Who will this day ascend this heavenly mound between your legs (adhyārokṣyati
    kas te ‘dya svargaṃ jaghanarūpiṇam), amply bound up in a golden girdle and having
    the likeness of golden discus?
17. “What other man is as distinguished as I? Śakra, Viṣṇu, the Aśvins? You will find
    no better man than me, O timid one!
18. “Take rest, O broad-hipped one, upon this lovely rock face. I am the master of the
    three worlds, having no peer!
19. “And so this Ten-Faced One, bowed and saluting, begs you, even though I am lord
    and master of the three worlds: Love me (bhajasva mām)!”
20. Rambhā, addressed thusly, saluted him and, trembling, said: “So please you, it
    does not behove you to say such things, for you are my guru.
21. “Rather, you should be protecting me, were I under threat of rape (dharṣaṇaṃ)
    from others, and by law (dharmatas) I am your daughter-in-law (snuṣā). This is the
    absolute truth I speak.”
22. She stood fixed, looking down at her feet, and Ten-Neck said to her: “You could
    only be my daughter-in-law if you were the wife of my son.”
23. Once he said this, Rambhā replied to Rāvaṇa: “Just so! O bull of the demons, I am
    by law the wife of your son.
    
    
    145
24. “The one known throughout the three worlds as Nalakūbara is the son, dearer
    than life, of your brother Vaiśravaṇa [Kubera].
25. “In dharma he is a Brahmin, in valour a Kṣatriya. When angry he is fire itself. He
    is forebearing as the earth.
26. “I have a rendez-vous (kṛtasaṃketā) with that son of the World-Protector [Kube-
    ra] and have donned all of these ornaments for him.
27. “I have affection for none other than him. By that truth, O foe-slaying King, you
    must release me!
28. “As we speak that righteous-souled one awaits, longing for me. You should not
    get in the way of [your] son (tan na vighnaṃ sutasyeha kartum arhasi), let me go!
29. “O bull of Rākṣasas, take the road followed by the righteous. Just as I should show
    respect to you, so should you indulge me.”
30. The powerful demon, deriding her speech though it was quite right and proper
    (dharmārthasahitaṃ vacaḥ), seized her by force as she was speaking. Enraged by the
    madness of lust, he began to rape her (maithunāyopacakrame).
31. Rambhā, her ornaments and garlands fallen to the ground, was then released, and
    was agitated like a river churned up by the playing of elephants.
32. Trembling, ashamed and terrified, she came to Nalakūbara and, saluting him with
    her hands, fell at his feet.
33. Great-sould Nalakūbara, seeing her in this state, said: “O lovely one, what is it?
    Why have you fallen at my feet?”
34. Sighing, trembling and saluting him, she began to explain to him all that had
    happened:
35. “O Lord, Ten-Neck has arrived here on his way to the Triviṣṭapa heaven, and he
    passed the night in the company of his army.
36. “He saw me as I was on my way to meet you, O foe-subduer. The demon seized
    me and asked to whom I belonged.
37. “I told him the whole truth about everything. But as he was completely overcome
    with the madness of lust, he did not heed my speech.
    
    
    Appendix 1
38. “O Lord, I begged him (yācyamāno mayā): ‘Lord, I am your step-daughter,’ but
    casting all that aside, he raped me by force (balāt tenāsmi dharṣitā).
39. “Please forgive me this offence (aparādhaṃ), O honourable one! The strength of
    women is not that of men, dear Sir!”
40. Hearing about this and the subsequent rape, enraged, the son of Vaiśvaraṇa
    thought carefully. 303
41. The son of Vaiśravaṇa, his eyes red with rage, reflecting on his deed, then after a
    moment took up water in his hand.
42. Taking up the water and sipping it according to the ritual practice, he cast a harsh
    curse upon the king of demons:
43. “Since he assaulted you violently and against your will, O fair one, he shall not
    approach another unwilling woman.
44. “When he, beset with lust, assaults a woman against her will, his head will shatter
    and split into seven pieces!”
45. When this curse, radiant as a kindled fire, was pronounced, divine drums sound-
    ed forth and a rain of flowers fell from the sky.
46. And all of the gods led by Prajāpati were delighted, thinking of the welfare of the
    world and the death of the demon.
47. But Ten-Neck, hearing that hair-raising curse, did not engage in sexual behavior
    among unwilling women (nārīṣu maithunaṃ bhāvaṃ nākāmāsv abhyarocayat).
    Sutherland-Goldman has demonstrated that this episode is part of a larger trend of
    narratives in the Vālmīki Uttarakāṇḍa treating the theme of sexual violence, and
    indeed is only one of three stories in which Rāvaṇa commits rape; the other two in-
    303 Nalakūbara “reflects deeply” or enters a meditative state (dhyānaṃ saṃpraviveśa). Suther-
    land Goldman’s reading of this is that “Nalakūbara, although he sees Rambhā’s dishevelled
    and distraught state, is unwilling to take her at her word without first verifying her account
    by determining the truth independently through meditation” (Sutherland Goldman 2018: 173
    note 32), and that “Nalakūbara is willing to accept her version of the events, but only upon
    verification. The implication, of course, is that women, naturally of uncontrolled sexuality,
    cannot be trusted to tell the truth, especially in such matters” (Sutherland Goldman 2018:
    175). Meanwhile as we have seen above, Nalakūbara’s reaction in the Rambhābhisāra gar-
    bhāṅka is one of immediate outrage and pity.
    
    
    147
    stances are the rape of Vedavatī and a large group of unnamed women (Rām 7.17 and
    7.24; Sutherland-Goldman 2018: 166–171). In all three cases, his behavior prompts
    curses and vows foreshadowing his downfall subsequent to the seizure of Sītā. The
    explicitness of Rāvaṇa’s rape of Rambhā is striking, and despite the fact that the
    demon is clearly meant to be portrayed as villainous and out of control, certain
    Rām manuscripts and those who commented upon them sought to palliate the scene
    (Sutherland Goldman 2018: 173–174).
    For the author of the HV App. I 29F episode, the Rambhābhisāra was clearly an
    independent performance unit, but tied to the Rāmāyaṇa. The performance troop
    first impresses the demon audiences living in the suburbs of Vajrapura with “a di-
    gest of the great poem Rāmāyaṇa, made into a play (rāmāyaṇaṃ mahākāvyam ud-
    deśaṃ nāṭakīkṛtam, HV App. I 29F line 242) in which several key scenes are de-
    picted. Later on, inside Vajrapura and before the eyes of Vajranābha, they perform
    opening songs, nāndīs, and eventually “the play called Rambhābhisāra by Kubera”
    (rambhābhisāraṃ kauveraṃ nāṭakaṃ nanṛtus, HV App. I 29F line 286), or perhaps
    kauveram simply means “having to do with Ku[b/v]era,” since of course its nāyaka
    is the son of the God of Wealth. The performance is also characterized as a “fic-
    tion-drama, the kīrti of the great-souled, all-knowing sage Nārada (prakaraṇaṃ ...
    nanṛtur ... nāradasya muneḥ kīrtiṃ sarvajñasya mahātmanaḥ, HV App. I 29F lines
    292–293). I have suggested above that Ravivarman, in cultivating his garbhāṅka
    from these Purāṇic seeds, may have been familiar with Vālmīki 7.26, particularly
    considering Vālmīki’s characterization of the distressed Rambhā as “agitated like a
    river churned up by the playing of elephants” (gajendrākrīḍamathitā nadīvākulitāṃ
    gatā, Rām 7.26.31) which possibly inspired Ravivarman’s similie “like a forest-pond
    disturbed by a mad elephant” (mattadvipena lulitā vanadīrghikeva, 3.17).

    Meters
    The TSS edition provides a ślokānukramaṇikā, which I do not reproduce here as digi-
    tized text searches have largely rendered such features unneccessary. The TSS how-
    ever did not identify meters. Ravivarman employs 25 different meters throughout the
    play, of which the most common are Vasantatilakā (24 occurences), Anuṣṭubh (23),
    Śārdūlavikrīḍita (17), Gīti (15), and Upajāti (11).
